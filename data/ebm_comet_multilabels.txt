largely O
lacking. O

The O
current O

gaps. O

Methods: O
Participants O

came O
to O
the O
lab O
on O
three O
consecutive O
days O

were O
repeatedly O
administered O
throughout O
the O

Results: O
Smoking O

for O
five O

resulted O
in O
a O
significant O
increase O
of O
exhaled B-Physiological-Clinical

, O
whereas O
using O
an O
IQOS(TM) O
resulted O
in O
a O
small O

immediately O
after O
smoking O
or O
using O

BACKGROUND: O
Post-traumatic O
Stress O
Disorder O
(PTSD) O
is O
a O
common O
sequelae O
of O
severe O
combat-related O
emotional O
trauma O
that O
is O
often O
associated O
with O
significantly O
reduced O
quality O
of O

in O
afflicted O

To O
date, O
no O
published O
study O
has O
examined O
the O
effect O
of O
an O
active, O
music-instruction O
intervention O
as O
a O
complementary O
strategy O
to O
improve O
the O
psychological O
well-being O
of O
veterans O
with O
PTSD. O

The O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
examine O
the O
feasibility B-Life-Impact
and O
potential O
effectiveness O
of O
an O
active, O
music-instruction O
intervention O
in O
improving O
psychological B-Life-Impact
health I-Life-Impact
and O
social B-Life-Impact
functioning I-Life-Impact
among O
Veterans O
suffering O
from O
moderate O
to O
severe O
PTSD. O

METHODS: O
The O
study O
was O
designed O
as O
a O
prospective, O
delayed-entry O
randomized O
pilot O
trial. O

Regression-adjusted O

RESULTS: O
Of O
the O
68 O
Veterans O
who O
were O
self- O
or O
provider-referred O
to O
the O
program, O
25 O
(36.7%) O
were O
ineligible O
due O
to O
(i) O
absence O
of O
a O

(n O

current O
resident O
of O
the O
Domiciliary O
(n O

8) O
and O
inability O
to O
participate O
due O
to O
distance O
of O
residence O
from O
the O
VA O
(n O
= O
8). O

Only O
3 O
(4.4%) O
Veterans O
declined O
participation O
due O
to O
lack O
of O
interest. O

The O
mean O
age O
of O
enrolled O
subjects O
was O
51 O
years O
old O
[range: O
22 O
to O
76]. O
The O
majority O
was O
male O
(90%). O

One-quarter O
were O
African O
American O
or O
Black. O

While O
30% O
report O
working O
full O
or O
part O
time, O
45% O
were O
retired O
due O
to O
disability. O

Slightly O
over O
one-quarter O
were O
veterans O
of O
the O
OEF/OIF O
wars. O

Estimates O
from O
regression-adjusted O
treatment O
effects O
indicate O
that O
the O
average O
PTSD B-Life-Impact
severity I-Life-Impact
score O
was O
reduced O
by O
9.7 O
points O
(p O
= O
0.01), O
or O
14.3% O
from O
pre- O
to O
post-intervention. O

Similarly, O
adjusted O
depressive B-Life-Impact
symptoms I-Life-Impact
were O
reduced O
by O
20.4% O
(- O
6.3 O
points, O
p O
= O
0.02). O

There O
were O
no O
statistically O
significant O
regression-adjusted O
effects O
on O
other O
outcomes, O
although O
the O
direction O
of O
change O
was O
consistent O
with O
improvements. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Our O
findings O
suggest O
that O
the O
active, O
music-instruction O
program O
holds O
promise O
as O
a O
complementary O
means O
of O
ameliorating O
PTSD B-Life-Impact
and O
depressive B-Life-Impact
symptoms I-Life-Impact
among O
this O
population. O

Introduction: O

(LCME). O

Methods: O
From O

students O
rotating O

meeting O
via O
Google O
Hangouts, O
or O
to O
a O
traditional O
in-person O
meeting O
for O
their O
MCF O
session. O

To O
compare O
students' O
MCF O
experiences O
we O
sent O
out O
an O
electronic O
survey O
afterward O
to O
assess O
the O
following O
using O
a O
0-100 O
sliding O
scale: O
overall O
satisfaction B-Life-Impact
with O
the O
meeting; O
the O
effectiveness O

; O
the O
helpfulness O
of O
the O
meeting; O
their O
stress B-Life-Impact
levels, O
and O
the O
convenience B-Life-Impact
of O
their O

location. O

The O
survey O
also O
collected O
data O
on O
these O
demographic O
variables: O
the O
name O
of O
the O
faculty O
member O
with O
whom O
the O
student O
met; O
student O
gender, O
age, O
and O

in O
EM; O
location O
prior O
to O
meeting; O

preference; O
and O
number O
of O
EM O
shifts O
completed. O

Results: O
During O
the O
study O
period, O
133 O
third-year O
medical O
students O
responded O
to O
the O
survey. O

When O
comparing O
survey O
responses O
between O
individuals O
who O
met O
online O
and O
in O
person, O
we O
did O
not O
detect O
a O
difference O
in O
demographics O
with O
the O
exception O
of O
preferred O
meeting O
method O
(p=0.0225). O

We O
found O
no O
significant O
differences O
in O
the O
overall O

helpfulness O
of O
the O
meeting, O
or O
stress O
levels O
of O

via O
videoconference O
vs. O
in-person O
(p=0.9909; O
p=0.8420; O
p=0.2352, O
respectively). O

However, O
individuals O
who O
met O
in-person O
with O
a O
faculty O
member O
rated O
effectiveness O
of O
communication B-Life-Impact
higher O
than O
those O
who O
met O
via O

(p=0.0002), O
while O
those O
who O
met O
online O
rated O
convenience B-Life-Impact
higher O
than O
those O
who O
met O
in-person O
(p<0.0001). O

Both O
effects O
remained O
significant O
after O
controlling O
for O
preferred O

method O
(p<0.0001 O
and O
p=0.0003, O
respectively) O
and O
among O
EM-bound O

(p=.0423 O

Conclusion: O
Our O
results O
suggest O
that O

BACKGROUND: O
Endometrial O
scratching O
(with O
the O
use O
of O
a O
pipelle O
biopsy) O
is O
a O
technique O
proposed O
to O
facilitate O

and O
increase O
the O
probability O
of O
pregnancy B-Physiological-Clinical
in O
women O
undergoing O
in O

fertilization O
(IVF). O

METHODS: O
We O
conducted O
a O
pragmatic, O
multicenter, O
open-label, O
randomized, O
controlled O
trial. O

Eligible O
women O
were O
undergoing O
IVF O
(fresh-embryo O
or O
frozen-embryo O
transfer), O
with O
no O
recent O
exposure O
to O
disruptive O
intrauterine O
instrumentation O
(e.g., O
hysteroscopy). O

Participants O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
in O
a O
1:1 O
ratio O
to O

preceding O
the O
embryo-transfer O
cycle O
and O
day O
3 O
of O
the O
embryo-transfer O
cycle) O
or O
no O
intervention. O

The O
primary O
outcome O
was O
live B-Mortality

. O
RESULTS: O
A O
total O
of O
1364 O
women O
underwent O
randomization. O

The O

OBJECTIVE:: O
With O
increasing O
incorporation O
of O
MRI O
in O
radiotherapy, O
we O
investigate O
two O
MRI O
sequences O
for O
prostate O
delineation O
in O

METHODS:: O
Five O
therapeutic O
radiographers O
contoured O
the O
prostate O
individually O
on O
CT, O
T2 O
weighted O
(T2W) O
and O
T2* O
weighted O
(T2*W) O
imaging O
for O
10 O
patients. O

Contours O
were O
analysed O
with O
Monaco O

to O
assess O
interobserver O

and O
accuracy O
by O
comparison O
with O
a O

Observers O
recorded O
time O
taken O
for O

and O
scored O
image O

and O
confidence O
in O
contouring. O

RESULTS:: O
There O
is O
good O
agreement O
when O
comparing O
radiographer O
contours O
to O
the O
gold-standard O

In O
addition, O
there O
is O
good O
concordance O
between O
radiographers O
across O
all O
imaging O
modalities. O

Both O
T2W O
and O
T2*W O

this O
was O
statistically O
significant O
for O
T2*W O
imaging O
compared O
to O

across O
all O
four O
comparison O
metrics. O

Comparing O
MRI O

reveals O
significantly O
reduced O
interobserver O
variability O
and O
significantly O
improved O
accuracy O
on O
T2*W O
compared O
to O
T2W O
MRI O
for O

Both O
MRI O
sequences O
scored O
significantly O
higher O
compared O
to O
CT O
for O
image O
quality O
and O
confidence O
in O
contouring, O
particularly O
T2*W. O
This O
was O
also O
reflected O
in O
the O
shorter O

respectively. O

Conclusion: O
Therapeutic O
radiographer O
prostate O
contours O
are O
more O
accurate, O
show O
less O

BACKGROUND: O
Krill O
powder O
is O
rich O
in O
bioactive O
ingredients O
such O
as O
eicosapentaenoic O
acid O
(EPA), O
docosahexaenoic O
acid O
(DHA), O
phospholipids, O
protein O
and O
astaxanthin. O

Containing O
dominantly O
EPA, O
it O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
lowering O
lipids, O
foremost O
serum O
triglycerides O
and O
LDL O
cholesterol. O

Krill-derived O
protein O
hydrolysates/peptides O
may O
have O
positive O
effect O
on O
blood O
pressure O
and O
astaxanthin O
has O
anti-oxidative O
and O
anti-inflammatory O
properties. O

Thus, O
krill O
powder O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
potential O
in O
improving O
lipid O
and O
metabolic O
profile O
and O
reinforcing O
the O
activity O
of O
the O
antioxidant O
system. O

However, O
randomized O
clinical O
trials O
on O
krill O
powder O
are O
scarce O
and O
systematic O
data O
of O
krill O
meal O
on O
human O
safety O
is O
limited. O

Some O
of O
the O
earlier O
studies O
have O
reported O
several, O
non-serious O
adverse O
events, O
mostly O
related O
to O
gastrointestinal O
tract, O
but O
systematic O
sufficiently O

is O
lacking. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
collect O
data O
on O
safety O
and O
tolerability B-Life-Impact
of O
krill O
powder O
in O
humans O
and O
simultaneously O
gain O
efficacy O

by O
measuring O
the O

BACKGROUND: O
Primary O
care O
physicians O
(PCPs) O
working O
in O
mental O
health O
care O
in O
Tunisia O
often O
lack O
knowledge O
and O
skills O
needed O
to O
adequately O
address O
mental O
health-related O
issues. O

To O
address O
these O
lacunas, O
a O
training O
based O
on O
the O
Mental O
Health O
Gap O
Action O
Programme O
(mhGAP) O
Intervention O
Guide O
(IG) O
was O
offered O
to O
PCPs O
working O
in O
the O
Greater O
Tunis O
area O
between O
February O
and O
April O
2016. O

While O
the O
mhGAP-IG O
has O
been O
used O
extensively O
in O
low- O
and O
middle-income O
countries O
(LMICs) O
to O
help O
build O
non-specialists' O
mental O
health O
capacity, O
little O
research O
has O
focused O
on O
how O
contextual O
factors O
interact O
with O
the O
implemented O
training O
program O
to O
influence O
its O
expected O
outcomes. O

This O
paper's O
objective O
is O
to O
fill O
that O
lack. O

METHODS: O
We O
conducted O
a O
case O
study O
with O
a O
purposeful O
sample O
of O
18 O
trained O
PCPs. O

Data O
was O
collected O
by O
semi-structured O
interviews O
between O
March O
and O
April O
2016. O

Qualitative O
data O
was O
analyzed O
using O
thematic O
analysis. O

RESULTS: O
Participants O
identified O
more O
barriers O
than O
facilitators O
when O
describing O
contextual O
factors O
influencing O
the O
mhGAP-based O
training's O
expected O
outcomes. O

Barriers O
were O
regrouped O
into O
five O
categories: O
structural O
factors O
(e.g., O
policies, O
social O
context, O
local O
workforce O
development, O
and O
physical O
aspects O
of O
the O
environment), O
organizational O
factors O
(e.g., O
logistical O
issues O
for O
the O
provision O
of O
care O
and O
collaboration O
within O
and O
across O
healthcare O
organizations), O
provider O
factors O
(e.g., O
previous O
mental O
health O
experience O
and O
personal O
characteristics), O
patient O
factors O
(e.g., O
beliefs O
about O
the O
health O
system O
and O
healthcare O
professionals, O
and O
motivation O
to O
seek O
care), O
and O
innovation O
factors O
(e.g., O
training O
characteristics). O

These O
contextual O
factors O
interacted O
with O
the O
implemented O
training O
to O
influence O
knowledge O
about O
pharmacological O
treatments O
and O
symptoms O
of O
mental O
illness, O
confidence O
in O
providing O
treatment, O
negative O
beliefs O
about O
certain O
mental O
health O
conditions, O
and O
the O
understanding O
of O
the O
role O
of O
PCPs O
in O
mental O
health O
care O
delivery. O

In O
addition, O
post-training, O
participants O
still O
felt O
uncomfortable O
with O
certain O
aspects O
of O
treatment O
and O
the O
management O
of O
some O
mental O
health O
conditions. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Findings O
highlight O
the O
complexity O
of O
implementing O
a O
mhGAP-based O
training O
given O
its O
interaction O
with O
contextual O
factors O
to O
influence O
the O
attainment O
of O
expected O
outcomes. O

Results O
may O
be O
used O
to O
tailor O
structural, O
organizational, O
provider, O
patient, O
and O
innovation O
factors O
prior O
to O
future O
implementations O
of O
the O
mhGAP-based O
training O
in O
Tunisia. O

Findings O
may O
also O
be O
used O
by O
decision-makers O
interested O
in O
implementing O
the O

training O
in O

DESIGN: O
Randomized O

METHODS: O
We O
studied O
40 O
morbidly O
obese O
individuals O
aged O
between O
25 O
and O
55 O
years O
who O
underwent O

preoperatively, O
and O
on O
the O
day O

(2nd O

They O
were O
randomly O
allocated O
into O
two O
groups: O
PAR-G O
(BiPAP O
in O

for O
one O
hour), O
and O
1PO-G O
(BIPAP O
for O
one O

on O
the O
1PO). O

RESULTS: O
In O
the O
PAR-G O
and O
1PO-G, O
respectively O
there O
were O
significant O
reductions O
in O
slow B-Physiological-Clinical

was O
maintained O
only O
for O
the O
PAR-G O
(p=0.4446 O

p=0.0191). O

Comparing O
the O
groups, O
the O
slow B-Physiological-Clinical

(p=0.0027) O
and O
forced B-Physiological-Clinical
vital I-Physiological-Clinical

(p=0.0028) O
showed O
a O
significant O
difference O
between O

while O
the O
PAR-G O
showed O
smaller O

in O
these O
capacities. O

The O
prevalence O
of O

was O
10% O
for O
the O
PAR-G O
and O
30% O

the O
1PO-G O
(p=0.0027). O

CONCLUSION: O
Thus, O
the O
use O
of O
BiPAP O
in O
PAR O
can O
promote O
restoration O
of O

contribute O
to O
the O
reduction O
of O

BACKGROUND: O
Heartburn O

Treatments O
for O
PPI-refractory O

are O
of O
unproven O
efficacy O

focus O
on O
controlling O
gastroesophageal O

with O
reflux-reducing O
medication O
(e.g., O
baclofen) O
or O
antireflux O
surgery O
or O
on O

BACKGROUND: O
Pharmacologic O
angiotensin O
axis O
blockade O
(AAB) O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
profound O
hypotension O
following O
anesthetic O
induction O
with O
propofol. O

To O
combat O
this O
problem, O
investigators O
have O
attempted O
to O
withhold O
angiotensin-converting O
enzyme O
inhibitors O
(ACEi) O
and O
angiotensin O
receptor O
blockers O
(ARB) O
preoperatively, O
or O
evaluated O
the O
effects O
of O
different O
induction O
agents O
in O
conferring O
greater O
hemodynamic O
stability. O

To O
date, O
methohexital O
has O
not O
been O
compared O
with O
the O
most O
commonly O
used O
induction O
agent, O
propofol. O

Hence, O
the O
primary O
objective O
was O
to O
study O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
methohexital O
confers O
a O
better O
hemodynamic B-Physiological-Clinical
profile O
than O
propofol O
for O
anesthetic O
induction, O
in O
patients O
receiving O
AAB. O

The O
secondary O
objective O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
postinduction O
levels O
of O
serum O
neurohormones B-Physiological-Clinical
in O
an O
attempt O
to O
explain O
the O
mechanisms O
involved. O

METHODS: O
Forty-five O
adult, O
hypertensive O
patients O
taking O
ACEi O
or O
ARB O
and O
scheduled O
for O
elective, O
noncardiac O
surgery O
completed O
the O
study. O

Patients O
were O
randomized O
to O
receive O
equi-anesthetic O
doses O
of O
either O
propofol O
or O
methohexital O
for O
anesthetic O
induction. O

Hemodynamic B-Physiological-Clinical
variables O
were O
measured O
and O
blood O
samples O
were O
drawn O
before O
induction O
and O
for O
15 O
minutes O
afterwards. O

RESULTS: O
Methohexital O
resulted O
in O
less O
hypotension B-Physiological-Clinical
compared O
with O
propofol O
(P O
= O
.01), O
although O
the O
degree O
of O
refractory B-Physiological-Clinical
hypotension I-Physiological-Clinical
was O
similar O
(P O
= O
.37). O

The O
postinduction O
systolic B-Physiological-Clinical
blood I-Physiological-Clinical
pressure I-Physiological-Clinical
(P O
= O
.03), O
diastolic B-Physiological-Clinical
blood I-Physiological-Clinical
pressure I-Physiological-Clinical
(P O
< O
.001) O
and O
heart B-Physiological-Clinical
rate I-Physiological-Clinical
(P O
= O
.03) O
were O
significantly O
higher O
in O
the O
methohexital O
group. O

A O
nonsignificant O
elevation O
of O
serum O
norepinephrine B-Physiological-Clinical
and O
epinephrine B-Physiological-Clinical
levels O
was O
observed O
in O
the O
methohexital O
group, O
while O
serum O
arginine B-Physiological-Clinical
vasopressin I-Physiological-Clinical
and O
angiotensin B-Physiological-Clinical
II I-Physiological-Clinical
levels O
did O
not O
differ O
between O
groups. O

CONCLUSION: O
While O
methohexital O
was O
shown O
to O
confer O
greater O
hemodynamic B-Physiological-Clinical
stability O
in O
patients O
taking O
ACEi/ARB, O
the O
measured O
hormone B-Physiological-Clinical
levels O
could O
not O
explain O
the O
mechanism O
for O
this O
effect. O

Therefore, O
in O
this O

BACKGROUND O
AND O
PURPOSE: O
Self-efficacy O
is O
considered O
as O
one O
of O
the O
influential O
parameters O
affecting O
the O
health O
of O
patients. O

This O
study O
aimed O
to O
investigate O
the O
effect O
of O
relaxation O
techniques O
on O
self-efficacy B-Life-Impact
of O
patients O
suffering O
from O
cancer. O

MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS: O
This O
study O
was O
a O
clinical O
trial O
in O
which O
80 O
patients O
suffering O
from O
cancer O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
two O
groups O
of O
experimental O
and O
control. O

Data O
collection O
instruments O
consisted O
of O
demographic O
information O
and O
Strategies O
Used O
by O
People O
to O
Promote O
Health O
questionnaires. O

In O
the O
experimental O
group, O
the O
patients O
performed O
relaxation O
techniques O
once O
a O
day O
for O
30min O
over O
two O
months. O

In O
the O
control O
group, O
the O
patients O
received O
the O
routine O
care. O

RESULTS: O
A O
statistically O
significant O
difference O
was O
observed O
between O
the O
mean O
self-efficacy B-Life-Impact
indices O
in O
the O
experimental O
group O
(p=0.001). O

There O
was O
no O
significant O
difference O
in O
the O
control O
group O
(p=0.3). O

CONCLUSION: O
Muscle O
relaxation O
can O
enhance O
self-efficacy B-Life-Impact
of O
cancer O
patients. O

Therefore, O
it O
can O
be O
used O
as O
an O
alternative O
method O
for O
patients O
who O
are O
willing O
to O
use O
this O
technique. O

RESULTS: O
In O
PBMCs, O
LF O
decreased O
ICAM1 O
mRNA B-Physiological-Clinical

(P O

0.05), O
which O

from O
the O

Also, O

LF O
decreased O
ICAM1 O

Moreover, O
the O

correlated O
positively O
with O
the O

A O

acid O
(ALA), O
decreased O
PBMC O

In O

BACKGROUND: O
Ovarian O

Though O
much O

Does O
the O

make O
a O

RESULTS: O
Thirty-four O

There O
were O

CONCLUSIONS: O
For O

PATIENTS O
AND O
METHODS: O
A O
multicentre, O
prospective, O
randomized, O
double-blind, O
placebo-controlled O
trial O
was O
undertaken O
involving O
229 O
patients O
undergoing O

using O
a O

approach, O
whose O
extended O

There O
were O
98 O
male O

131 O
female O
patients, O
with O
a O
mean O
age O
of O
65.5 O
years O
(32 O

The O
primary O
outcome, O
perioperative O

was O
evaluated O
at O
72 O

long-TXA O
protocols O
in O
the O
reduction O
of O

RESULTS: O
TXA O
significantly O
reduced O
perioperative O
blood B-Physiological-Clinical
loss I-Physiological-Clinical
compared O
with O
placebo O
(p O
< O
0.001); O
the O
mean O
differences O
were O
525.3 O
ml O
(short-TXA O
vs O
placebo) O
and O
550.1 O
ml O
(long-TXA O
vs O

No O
venous B-Physiological-Clinical

reported. O

The O
upper O
boundary O
of O
the O

BACKGROUND: O
Nutrition O

In O
this O

one O
of O
the O
key O

that O

done O
by O

there O
is O
a O
paucity O
of O

in O
this O

and O
the O
results O
of O
these O
few O
studies O
are O
an O
area O
of O
ongoing O
debates. O

In O

of O
this, O
the O

is O
an O
attempt O
to O
determine O
the O

of O
different O

METHODS: O
A O
clinical O
trial O
cross-over O
study O
was O
carried O
out O
on O
premature O
infants O
in O
NICU. O

The O
subjects, O
who O
had O
inclusion O
criteria, O
were O
selected O
through O
convenience O
sampling O
based O
on O
inclusion O
criteria O
and O
randomly O
allocated O
into O
three O
groups. O

Gastric B-Physiological-Clinical
residual I-Physiological-Clinical
volume I-Physiological-Clinical
before O
and O
one O
hours O
after O
feeding O
was O
measured O
and O
recorded O
for O
three O
positions O
including O
right-lateral, O
left-lateral, O
and O
prone. O

The O
data O
was O
analyzed O
via O
SPSS-21 O
using O
descriptive O
statistics O
such O
as O
mean, O
standard O
deviation, O
and O
frequency; O
and O
inferential O
statistics O
such O
as O
Chi O
Squared, O
Kruskal O
Wallis O
test, O
and O
Friedman O
test. O

RESULTS: O
Totally, O
135 O
infants O
in O
three O
groups O
were O
studied O
and O
the O
results O
showed O
that O
minimum O
and O
maximum O
gastric B-Physiological-Clinical
residual I-Physiological-Clinical
volumes I-Physiological-Clinical
were O
in O
prone O
(6.49 O
+/- O
8.25 O
ML) O
and O
supine O
(12.59 O
+/- O
11.9 O
ML) O
positions, O
respectively. O

However, O
Kruskal O
Wallis O
test O
did O
not O
show O
a O
significant O
relationship O
between O
the O
three O
positions O
under O
study O
and O
the O
mean O
gastric B-Physiological-Clinical
residual I-Physiological-Clinical
volume I-Physiological-Clinical
. O
CONCLUSION: O
Prone O
position O
was O
featured O
with O
the O
lowest O
gastric B-Physiological-Clinical
residual I-Physiological-Clinical
volume I-Physiological-Clinical
and O
highest O
possibility O
of O
absorbing B-Physiological-Clinical

. O
Still, O
given O
the O
fact O
that O
no O
significant O
difference O
was O
found O
in O
the O
three O
groups, O
further O
and O

PURPOSE: O
While O
some O
micro-organisms, O
such O
as O
Staphylococcus O
aureus, O
are O
clearly O
implicated O
in O
causing O
tissue O
damage O
in O

(DFUs), O
our O
knowledge O
of O
the O
contribution O
of O
the O
entire O
microbiome O
to O
clinical O
outcomes O
is O
limited. O

We O
profiled O
the O
microbiome O
of O
a O
longitudinal O
sample O
series O
of O
28 O
people O
with O
diabetes O
and O
DFUs O
of O

in O
an O
attempt O
to O
better O
characterize O
the O
relationship O
between O

and O

METHODOLOGY: O
In O
total, O
237 O
samples O
were O
analysed O
from O
28 O
DFUs, O
collected O
at O
fortnightly O
intervals O
for O
6 O
months O
or O
until O
healing. O

Microbiome O
profiles O
were O
generated O
by O
16S O
rRNA O
gene O
sequence O
analysis, O
supplemented O
by O
targeted O
nanopore O
sequencing. O

Result/Key O
findings. O

DFUs O
which O
failed O
to O
heal O
during O
the O
study O
period O
(20/28, O
71.4 O
%) O
were O
more O
likely O
to O
be O
persistently O
colonized O
with O
a O
heterogeneous O
community O
of O
micro-organisms O
including O
anaerobes O
and O
Enterobacteriaceae O
(log-likelihood O
ratio O
9.56, O
P=0.008). O

During O
clinically O
apparent O
infection, O
a O
reduction O
in O
the O
diversity O
of O
micro-organisms O
in O
a O
DFU O
was O
often O
observed O
due O
to O
expansion O
of O
one O
or O
two O
taxa, O
with O
recovery O
in O
diversity O
at O
resolution. O

Modelling O
of O
the O
predicted O
species O
interactions O
in O
a O
single O
DFU O
with O
high O
diversity O
indicated O
that O
networks O
of O
metabolic O
interactions O
may O
exist O
that O
contribute O
to O
the O
formation O
of O
stable O
communities. O

CONCLUSION: O
Longitudinal O
profiling O
is O
an O
essential O
tool O
for O
improving O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
microbiology O
of O
chronic O
wounds, O
as O
community O
dynamics O
associated O
with O
clinical O
events O
can O
only O
be O
identified O
by O
examining O
changes O
over O
multiple O
time O
points. O

The O
development O
of O
complex O
communities, O
particularly O
involving O
Enterobacteriaceae O
and O
strict O
anaerobes, O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
poor O
outcomes O
in O
DFUs O
and O
requires O
further O
investigation. O

Introduction: O
Peri- O
and O
postmenopausal O
women O
frequently O
suffer O
from O
urinary O
incontinence O
(UI). O

Generally, O
UI O
becomes O
more O
severe O
with O
age. O

It O
impacts O
physical, O
mental, O
and O
social O
functioning O
as O
well O
as O
the O
quality O
of O
life, O
often O
leading O
to O
depression. O

Extracorporeal O
magnetic O
innervation O
(ExMI) O
is O
a O
relatively O
new O
conservative O
treatment O
method O
for O
UI. O

Objective: O
The O
aim O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
assess O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
ExMI O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O

were O
included O
in O
the O

the O
experimental O
group O
(EG) O
and O
24 O
to O
the O

group O
(CG). O

The O
average O
age O
was O
65.41 O
years O
(+/-SD O
4.08). O

EG O

three O
times O
a O

No O

To O
objectify O
the O
treatment O
outcomes O
in O
both O

before O
and O
after O
the O
treatment, O
we O
measured O

Results: O
The O

Recent O

The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
the O

in O
cashew O
nuts. O

Eighteen O
healthy O

were O
enrolled O
in O
a O

Subjects O
were O

with O
either O
no O

or O
with O
the O

of O
42 O
g/day O
(1.5 O
servings) O
of O
cashew O
nuts, O
with O
the O
final O
treatment O
diets O
being O
isocaloric. O

Complete O
diet O
collections O
were O
analyzed O
for O
nitrogen O
(for O

fat, O
energy, O
and O

by O
difference. O

During O
the O
final O
week O
of O
each O
intervention O
phase, O
subjects O
collected O
all O
feces O

produced, O
and O
these O

analyzed O
for O
nitrogen B-Physiological-Clinical
(feces O

energy B-Physiological-Clinical
(feces O

and O

The O

were O
used O
to O
calculate O
the O
metabolizable O

the O

The O
average O

was O
137 O
kcal O
(+/-3.4 O

SEM) O
and O
ranged O
from O
105 O
to O
151 O

The O
mean O
value O
of O
137 O
kcal/serving O
is O
16% O
lower O
(p O
< O
0.0001) O
than O
what O
is O
typically O
found O
on O
food O
labels. O

Digestibility O
of O
energy, O
fat, O
protein, O
and O
carbohydrate O
was O
lower O
for O
the O
cashew-containing O
diet O
compared O
to O
the O
control O
diet O
(92.9% O
vs. O
94.9%, O
p O

BACKGROUND: O
Large O
scale O
administration O
of O
the O
anthelminthic O
drug O
praziquantel O
(PZQ) O
to O
at-risk O
populations O
is O
the O
cornerstone O
of O
schistosomiasis O
control, O
although O
persisting O
high O
prevalence O
of O
infections O
in O
some O
areas O
and O
growing O
concerns O
of O
PZQ O
resistance O
have O
revealed O
the O
limitations O
of O
this O
strategy. O

Most O
studies O
assessing O
PZQ O
efficacy O
have O
used O
relatively O
insensitive O
parasitological O
diagnostics, O
such O
as O
the O
Kato-Katz O
(KK) O
and O
urine-filtration O
methods, O
thereby O
overestimating O
cure O
rates O
(CRs). O

This O
study O
aims O
to O
determine O
the O
efficacy O
of O
repeated O
PZQ O
treatments O
against O
Schistosoma B-Physiological-Clinical
mansoni I-Physiological-Clinical
infection I-Physiological-Clinical
in O
school-aged O
children O
in O
Cote O
d'Ivoire O
using O
the O
traditional O
KK O
technique, O
as O
well O
as O
more O
sensitive O
antigen- O
and O
DNA-detection O
methods. O

METHODS: O
An O
open-label, O
randomised O
controlled O
trial O
will O
be O
conducted O
in O
school-aged O
children O
(5 O
to O
18 O
years) O
from O
the O
region O
of O
Taabo, O
Cote O
d'Ivoire, O
an O
area O
endemic O
for O
S. O
mansoni. O

This O
8-week O
trial O
includes O
four O
two-weekly O
standard O
doses O
of O
PZQ O
in O
the O
"intense O
treatment" O
intervention O
group O
and O
one O
standard O
dose O
of O
PZQ O
in O
the O
"standard O
treatment" O
control O
group. O

The O
efficacy O
of O
PZQ O
will O
be O
evaluated O
in O
stool O
samples O
using O
the O
KK O
technique O
and O
real-time O
PCR O
as O
well O
as O
in O
urine O
using O
the O
point-of-care O
circulating O
cathodic O
antigen O
test O
and O
the O
up-converting O
phosphor, O
lateral O
flow, O
circulating O
anodic O
antigen O
assay. O

The O
primary O
outcome O
of O
the O
study O
will O
be O
the O
difference O
in O
cure B-Physiological-Clinical
rate O
of O
intense O
versus O
standard O
treatment O
with O
PZQ O
on O
individuals O
with O
a O
confirmed O
S.mansoni O
infection O
measured O
by O
KK. O

Secondary O
outcomes O
include O
the O

in O
cure B-Physiological-Clinical
rate O
and O
intensity B-Physiological-Clinical
reduction O
rate O
between O
the O
intense O
and O
standard O

groups O
as O
measured O
by O
the O
other O
diagnostic O
tests, O
as O
well O
as O
the O
accuracy O
of O
the O
different O
diagnostic O
tests, O
and O
the O
safety O
of O
PZQ. O

DISCUSSION: O
This O
study O
will O
provide O
data O
on O
the O
efficacy O
of O
repeated O
PZQ O
treatment O
on O
the O
clearance O
of O

Further O

MATERIAL O
AND O
METHODS: O
The O

All O
men O
received O

in O
the O
intervention O
group O
(IG) O
also O
received O
oral O

information O
about O

BACKGROUND: O
Based O
on O
epidemiological O
and O
clinical O
data O
acute O
appendicitis O
can O
present O
either O
as O
uncomplicated O
(70-80%) O
or O
complicated O
(20-30%) O
disease. O

Recent O
studies O
have O
shown O
that O
antibiotic O
therapy O
is O
both O
safe O
and O
cost-effective O
for O
a O
CT-scan O
confirmed O
uncomplicated O
acute O
appendicitis. O

However, O
based O
on O
the O
study O
protocols O
to O
ensure O
patient O
safety, O
these O
randomised O
studies O
used O
mainly O
broad-spectrum O
intravenous O
antibiotics O
requiring O
additional O
hospital O
resources O
and O
prolonged O
hospital O
stay. O

As O
we O
now O
know O
that O
antibiotic O
therapy O
for O
uncomplicated O
acute O
appendicitis O
is O
feasible O
and O
safe, O
further O

evaluating O
optimisation O
of O
the O
antibiotic O
treatment O
regarding O
both O
antibiotic O

are O
needed O
to O
evaluate O
antibiotics O
as O
the O
first-line O
treatment O
for O

will O
be O
enrolled O
in O
nine O
Finnish O
hospitals. O

The O

Interestingly, O
the O

BACKGROUND: O
Health O
promotion O
programs O
can O
only O
lead O
to O
improvements O
in O
health O
outcomes O
if O
they O
are O
effectively O
implemented. O

However, O
most O
studies O
assessing O
implementation O
success O
focus O
on O
only O
one O
condition, O
although O
more O
conditions O
influence O
this O
process. O

Therefore, O
evidence O
is O
scarce O
on O
what O
conditions O
play O
a O
role O
in O
successful O
implementation O
and O
how O
they O
interact. O

Hence, O
we O
aimed O
to O
identify O
which O
combinations O
of O
teacher O
and O
implementation O
process O
characteristics O
affected O
the O
emotional B-Life-Impact
and O
social O
school O

(SCE) O
of O
pupils O
participating O
in O
a O
school-based O
health O

METHODS: O
This O
study O
was O
part O
of O
an O
effectiveness O

evaluation O
including O
24 O
intervention O
and O
27 O

classes. O

We O
used O
fuzzy-set O
qualitative O

analysis O
(fsQCA) O
to O
identify O
combinations O
of O
conditions O
that O
were O
associated O
with O
either O
an O
increase O
or O
no O
increase O
in O
the O
outcome O
emotional B-Life-Impact
and O
social O
school O
experience O
(SCE) O
in O
comparison O
to O
the O
control O
group O
at O
20 O
months O
post O

We O
deductively O
selected O
five O
conditions O
based O
on O
the O
Consolidated O
Framework O
for O
Implementation O
Research: O
teachers' O
perceived O
self-efficacy B-Life-Impact
, O
teachers' O
expectations B-Life-Impact
of O
the O

, O
and O
quality B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact

. O
RESULTS: O
We O
identified O
five O
different O
pathways O
that O
led O
to O
no O
increase O
in O
the O
pupils' O
outcome O
(parameters O
of O
fit: O
consistency O
94%, O

66%). O

The O
combination O
of O
an O
unsatisfying O
quality B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact
implementing I-Life-Impact
the O
intervention O
and O
a O
low O
previous O
knowledge B-Life-Impact
about O
the O
intervention O
showed O
the O
highest O
empirical O
relevance. O

Similarly, O
fewer O
physical B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact
breaks I-Life-Impact
in O
combination O
with O
other O
conditions O
impeded O
the O
program's O
success. O

Furthermore, O
we O
identified O
two O
different O
pathways O
characterizing O
ways O
to O
success O
(consistency: O
81%, O
coverage: O
52%). O

The O
most O
relevant O
combination O
was O
good O
quality O
implementation O
of O
physical B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact
breaks I-Life-Impact
, O
implemented O
by O
teachers O
with O
a O
high O
self-efficacy B-Life-Impact
, O
and O
a O
good O
previous O
knowledge B-Life-Impact
about O
the O
intervention. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
QCA O
has O
potential O
for O
an O
in-depth O
analysis O
of O
complex O
interventions O
as O
it O
can O
rely O
on O

The O

be O
improved O
by O
considering O
the O
following O
suggestions: O
The O

BACKGROUND: O
Schools O
have O
been O

has O
showed O
that O
they O
may O

can O
provide O
information O
on O
which O
aspects O
of O
an O

were O
delivered O
and O
how. O

Therefore, O
the O
purpose O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
use O
a O
combination O
of O
methods O
to O
elicit O
child O

regarding O
the O
feasibility B-Life-Impact
and O

of O
the O
AS:Sk O
intervention, O
alongside O

The O
overarching O
study O
aim O
was O
to O
understand O
how O
schools O
implemented B-Life-Impact
the O

intervention, O
with O
a O
specific O

, O
and O
how O
the O
components O
were O
incorporated B-Life-Impact
into O
the O
school O

METHODS: O
The O
study O
generated O
five O
data O

Data O
elicited O
from O
18 O
participating O
children O
via O
a O

Teacher O
verbatim O
data O
was O
collected O
from O
3 O
interviews, O
and O
18 O
researcher O
observations O
were O
recorded O
using O
field O
notes. O

The O
data O
sources O
were O
pooled O
to O
produce O
the O
themes O
presented O
in O
the O
results O
section. O

RESULTS: O
The O
combination O
of O
data O
sources O
revealed O
four O
themes O
and O
16 O
sub-themes. O

Implementation O
methods: O
how O
and O
when O
the O
components O
were O
implemented B-Life-Impact
in O
schools. O

Child O
engagement: O
enjoyment O
and O
positive O
behaviour. O

Facilitators: O
peer O
influence, O
teacher O
influence, O
staggered O
implementation, O
incentives, O
rewards, O
challenges O
and O
competition, O
flexibility O
and O
adaptability, O
child O
ownership, O
routine. O

Barriers: O
time O
within O
an O
intense O
curriculum, O
space, O
sustaining O
child O
interest, O
parental O
support, O
school O
policies. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
study O
revealed O
that O
teachers O
believed O
classroom O
based O
activities O
were O
most O
feasible B-Life-Impact
and O
acceptable B-Life-Impact
due O
to O
the O
reduced O
implementation O
barriers O
of O
sufficient O
time O
and O
space. O

In O
contrast, O
children O
reported O
that O
the O
activities O
outside O
of O
the O
classroom O
were O
preferred B-Life-Impact
. O
Future O
school-based O
PA O
interventions O
should O
aim O
to O
achieve O
a O
balance O
between O
routine O
PA O
at O
a O
set O

and O
PA O
that O
is O
flexible O
and O

Further O
process O

INTRODUCTION: O
Noggin O
is O
an O
antagonist O
of O
bone O
morphogenetic O
proteins O
(BMPs) O
and O
has O
a O
strong O
effect O
on O
osteogenesis. O

Osteoporosis O
is O
a O
common O
complication O
of O
transfusion O
dependent O
beta-thalassemia O
(TDT) O
and O
denosumab O
has O
been O
recently O
emerged O
as O
a O
promising O
therapeutic O
option. O

This O
was O
a O
post O
hoc O
investigation O
of O
serum O
noggin B-Physiological-Clinical
levels O
among O
TDT O
patients O
with O
osteoporosis O
who O
participated O
in O
a O
randomized, O
placebo-control, O
phase O
2b O
study. O

METHODS: O
Patients O
received O
either O
60 O
mg O
denosumab O
(n O
= O
32) O
or O
placebo O
(n O
= O
31) O
every O
6 O
months O
for O
12 O
months. O

Noggin B-Physiological-Clinical
was O
measured, O
for O
the O
first O
time O
in O
thalassemia O
patients, O
at O
baseline O
and O
at O
12 O
months, O
using O
a O
recently O
developed O
high O
sensitivity O
fluorescent O
immunoassay. O

RESULTS: O
Both O
groups O
showed O
a O
significant O
increase O
in O
noggin B-Physiological-Clinical
serum O
levels O
(denosumab O
p O
< O
0.001; O
placebo O
p O
< O
0.0001). O

Interestingly, O
the O
increase O
was O
higher O
in O
the O
placebo O
group. O

Furthermore, O
we O
observed O
a O
strong O
correlation O
between O
noggin B-Physiological-Clinical
and O
wrist B-Physiological-Clinical
bone I-Physiological-Clinical
mineral I-Physiological-Clinical
density I-Physiological-Clinical
(r O
= O
-0.641, O
p O
= O
0.002) O
only O
in O
the O
denosumab O
group. O

CONCLUSION: O
In O
conclusion, O
higher O
noggin B-Physiological-Clinical
levels O
reflected O
more O
BMP O
inhibition, O
since O
our O
assay O
detects O
free O
bioactive O
noggin B-Physiological-Clinical
, O
which O
in O
turn O
impaired O
bone O
formation O
in O
placebo O
group. O

Therefore, O
denosumab O
possibly O
regulates O
noggin B-Physiological-Clinical
and O
favours O
bone O
turnover O
in O
TDT O
patients O
with O
osteoporosis O
through O
a O
novel O
mechanism O
of O
action. O

BACKGROUND: O
Ascorbic O
acid O
is O
a O
water-soluble O
chain O
breaking O
antioxidant. O

It O
scavenges O
free O
radicals O
and O
reactive O
oxygen O
species O
(ROS), O
which O
are O
produced O
during O
metabolic O
pathways. O

Exercise O
can O
produce O
an O
imbalance O
between O
ROS O
and O
antioxidants, O
leading O
to O
oxidative O
stress-related O
tissue O
damages. O

This O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
determine O
the O
effects O
of O
ascorbic O

on O
circulating O
biomarkers O
of O
oxidative B-Physiological-Clinical
stress I-Physiological-Clinical
and O

, O
oxidative B-Physiological-Clinical

RESULTS: O
Plasma O

increased O
immediately O

The O

INTERVENTION(S): O
We O
randomly O
assigned O
participants O
to O
1 O
of O
4 O
groups: O
rigid O
taping, O
Kinesio O
taping, O
placebo, O
or O

groups, O
we O
applied O

MAIN O
OUTCOME O
MEASURE(S): O
We O
evaluated O
all O
groups O
for O
observable O
scapular B-Physiological-Clinical
dyskinesis I-Physiological-Clinical
using O
the O
scapular O
dyskinesis O
test, O

index O
at O
baseline, O
immediately O
after O
taping, O
and O
at O
60 O

72 O
hours O
after O
taping. O

RESULTS: O
The O
scapular B-Physiological-Clinical
dyskinesis I-Physiological-Clinical

increased O
immediately O
and O
at O
60 O
to O
72 O
hours O
after O
taping O
in O
the O
rigid-taping O
and O
Kinesio-taping O
groups. O

We O
observed O
no O

for O
the O
change O
in O
the O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Rigid O
or O
Kinesio O

BACKGROUND: O
Single O

whether O

SAI O
were O
classified O

The O

assessed O
the O

The O

BACKGROUND/AIMS: O
Diabetic O
kidney O
disease O
(DKD) O
is O
a O
leading O
cause O
of O
end-stage O
renal O
disease O
(ESRD) O
worldwide, O
and O
the O
importance O
of O
tubular O

has O
been O
highlighted O
in O
recent O
years. O

However, O
the O
underlying O
mechanisms O
and O
effective O
therapeutic O
targets O
are O
still O
unclear. O

In O
this O
study, O
we O
investigated O
mtDNA B-Physiological-Clinical
, O
mitochondrial B-Physiological-Clinical
dynamics I-Physiological-Clinical
, I-Physiological-Clinical
function I-Physiological-Clinical
and O
metabolic O
pathways O
to O
determine O
if O
mitochondrial O
damage O
plays O
a O
critical O
role O
in O
the O
development O
of O
tubular O
injury O
in O
DKD O
patients. O

METHODS: O
A O
cross-sectional O

were O
obtained O
from O
participants. O

Metabolomics O
was O
employed O
to O
investigate O
cellular B-Physiological-Clinical
metabolism I-Physiological-Clinical

Mitochondrial B-Physiological-Clinical
fragmentation I-Physiological-Clinical
was O
specifically O
presented O
in O
tubules, O
but O
not O
in O

CONCLUSION: O
Our O
study O
indicates O
that O
mitochondrial B-Physiological-Clinical
damage I-Physiological-Clinical
could O
be O
the O
hallmark O
of O
tubular O

trial O
was O
conducted O
from O
April O
to O
October O
2015 O
in O
Tabriz, O

who O
were O
frequently O
referred O
to O
the O
private O
obstetrics O

In O
this O
study O
62 O
subjects O
were O
randomly O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
management O
of O
acute O
esophageal O
variceal O
bleeding O
remains O
a O
clinical O
challenge. O

Band O
ligation O
is O
the O
main O
therapeutic O
option, O
but O
it O
may O
be O
technically O
difficult O
to O
perform O
in O
active O
bleeders. O

This O
may O
necessitate O
an O
alternative O
therapy O
for O
this O
group O
of O
patients. O

This O
study O
was O
conducted O
to O
assess O
the O
safety O
and O
efficacy O
of O
sclerotherapy O
versus O
cyanoacrylate O
injection O
for O
management O
of O
actively O
bleeding O
esophageal O
varices O
in O
cirrhotic O
patients. O

METHODS: O
This O
prospective O
study O
included O
113 O
cirrhotic O
patients O
with O
actively O
bleeding O
esophageal O
varices. O

They O
were O
randomly O
treated O
by O
endoscopic O
sclerotherapy O
or O
cyanoacrylate O
injection O
as O
banding O
was O
not O
suitable O
for O
those O
patients O
due O
to O
profuse O
bleeding O
making O
unclear O
endoscopic O
visual O
field. O

Primary O
outcome O
was O
incidence O
of O
active O
bleeding B-Physiological-Clinical
control I-Physiological-Clinical
and O
secondary O
outcomes O
were O
incidence O
of O
six O
weeks O

, O
complications B-Adverse-effects
, O
and O
mortality B-Mortality
among O
the O
studied O
patients. O

RESULTS: O
Initial O
bleeding B-Physiological-Clinical
control I-Physiological-Clinical
was O
significantly O
higher O
in O
cyanoacrylate O
versus O
sclerotherapy O
groups O
(98.25, O
83.93% O
respectively, O
P O
= O
0.007). O

No O
significant O
differences O
between O
sclerotherapy O
and O
cyanoacrylate O
groups O
regarding O
rebleeding B-Physiological-Clinical
(26.79, O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Based O
on O
this O
single-center O
prospective O
study, O
both O
of O
these O
therapies O
appear O
to O
have O
relatively O
favorable O
outcomes, O
although O

PURPOSE: O
To O
evaluate O
3-dimensional O

in O
patients O

keratomileusis O
(LASIK) O

METHODS: O
In O
a O
prospective O
randomized O
contralateral O
eye O
study O
of O
LASIK O
versus O
SMILE O
procedures, O
21 O
consecutive O

evaluated O
with O
corneal O
epithelial O
mapping O
by O

for O
up O

2 O
years. O

RESULTS: O
In O
the O
LASIK O
group, O
central B-Physiological-Clinical
epithelial I-Physiological-Clinical
thickness I-Physiological-Clinical
increased O
from O
52.38 O
+/- O
2.57 O
mum O
to O
57.00 O
+/- O
4.23 O
mum O
and O
remained O
almost O
stable O
at O
this O
level O
for O
up O
to O
24 O
months. O

In O
the O
SMILE O
eyes, O
it O
increased O
from O
52.52 O
+/- O
3.01 O
mum O
to O
57.15 O
+/- O
4.57 O
mum O
and O
also O
remained O
stable O
for O
up O
to O
24 O
months. O

Both O
techniques O
created O
the O
same O
level O
of O
epithelial B-Physiological-Clinical
thickness I-Physiological-Clinical
increase O
and O
variation, O
with O
a O
significantly O
higher O
mid-peripheral B-Physiological-Clinical
epithelial I-Physiological-Clinical
thickness I-Physiological-Clinical
increase. O

The O
differences O
between O
the O
preoperative O
and O
postoperative O
changes O
were O
found O
statistically O
significant, O
but O
not O
different O
between O
the O
2 O
techniques O
at O
any O
given O
time O
studied. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Both O
LASIK O
and O
SMILE O
resulted O
in O
significant O
epithelial B-Physiological-Clinical
thickening I-Physiological-Clinical
. O
This O
response O
seemed O
to O
be O
surprisingly O
quite O
similar O
between O
the O
2 O
different O
techniques. O

This O
study O
suggests O
that O
epithelial O
remodeling O
may O
correlate O
with O
relative O
curvature O
changes O
resulting O
after O
both O
techniques, O
rather O
than O
the O
obvious O

subepithelial O

BACKGROUND: O
The O
onset O
of O
puberty O
and O
menarche O
is O
a O
specifically O
vulnerable O
time O
for O
girls, O
during O
which O
they O
begin O
to O
show O
interest O
in O
the O
opposite O
sex, O
while O
becoming O
exposed O
to O
a O
myriad O
of O
external O
pressures, O
including O
sexual O
coercion O
or O
harassment O
from O
boys O
and O
men, O
expectations O
to O
marry O
from O
their O
families, O
and O
the O
need O
to O
perform O
well O
in O
primary O
school O
in O
order O
to O
qualify O
for O
secondary O
school. O

According O
to O
several O
qualitative O
studies O
in O
Africa, O
such O
pressures O
are O
exacerbated O
by O
girls' O
lack O
of O
knowledge O
of O
their O
bodies, O
their O
rights, O
and O
the O
implications O
of O
their O
decisions, O
and O
by O
their O
inability O
to O
manage O
puberty O
and O
adolescence O
safely O
and O
comfortably O
with O

METHODS: O
The O
design O
for O
the O
evaluation O
of O
the O

at O
the O
completion O
of O
the O
18-month O

in O
three O
rural O
sub-counties O
(Magarini, O
Kaloleni O
and O
Ganze) O
of O
Kilifi O
County O
in O
the O
Coastal O
area O
of O
Kenya. O

The O
research O
sample O
includes O
3489 O
girls, O
with O
about O
25 O
girls O
per O
school O
on O
average. O

Before O
program O
implementation, O
the O
schools O
were O
stratified O
by O
sub-county O
and O
randomized O
to O
one O
of O
four O
study O

INTRODUCTION: O
Halitosis O
is O
the O
term O
used O
to O
describe O
any O
unpleasant O
odor O
relative O
to O
expired O
air O
regardless O
of O
its O
source. O

The O
prevalence O
of O
halitosis O
in O
the O
population O
is O
approximately O
30%, O
of O
which O
80 O
to O
90% O
of O
the O
cases O
originate O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
resulting O
from O
proteolytic O
degradation O
by O
gram O
negative O
anaerobic O
bacteria. O

Antimicrobial O
photodynamic O
therapy O
(aPDT) O
has O
been O
widely O
used O
with O
very O
satisfactory O
results O
in O
the O
health O
sciences. O

It O
involves O
the O
use O
of O
a O
non-toxic O
dye, O
called O
photosensitizer O
(FS), O
and O
a O
light O
source O
of O
a O
specific O
wavelength O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
environmental O
oxygen. O

This O
interaction O
is O
capable O
of O
creating O
toxic O
species O
that O
generate O
cell O
death. O

The O
objective O
of O
this O
controlled O
clinical O
study O
is O
to O
verify O
the O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
therefore O
to O
explore O
reasons O
for O
employee O
engagement O
in O
weight O
loss O
projects O
at O
the O
workplace O
and O
the O
incentives O
a O
municipality, O
a O
manager O
at O
a O
home-care O
centre, O
and O
a O
project O
manager O
have O
to O
launch O
such O
project. O

METHODS: O
A O
stratified O
case O
study O
was O
conducted. O

A O
representative O
from O
the O
municipality, O
the O
manager O
at O
a O
home-care O
centre, O
the O
project O
manager O
of O
the O
weight O

intervention O
and O
six O
health-care O
workers O
were O
interviewed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O
one-year O
weight O

intervention O
at O
the O
workplace. O

Data O
were O
analysed O
using O
Systematic O

RESULTS: O
Analysis O
identified O
different O
views O
and O
considerations O
for O
engaging O
in O
a O
weight O

at O
the O
workplace. O

For O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
municipality O
the O
possible O
economical O

of O
the O
project O
was O
in O
focus. O

The O
project O
manager O
and O
the O
manager O
of O
the O
home-care O
centre O
both O
reflected O
mainly O
on O
improvement O
of O
the O
healthcare O
workers O
health. O

For O
the O
project O
manager, O
achieving O
good O
scientific O
results O
was O
highlighted O
as O
well. O

However, O
the O
employees O
were O
influenced O
by O
several O
factors, O
such O
as O
their O
own O
health O
and O
weight O
loss, O
the O
pressure O
from O
the O
environment O
and O
their O
struggle O
for O
recognition. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
This O
study O
concluded O
that O
if O
targeting O
the O

BACKGROUND: O
We O
examined O
whether O

among O
a O

of O

prior O
to O
viewing O

We O
also O
examined O
how O

influences O
these O

and O
whether O
there O
is O
an O
interaction O
between O

METHODS: O
In O
this O
experimental O
human O
laboratory O
study, O
participants O
(n O

were O
randomised O
to O
a O
self-affirmation O
or O

group. O

After O
the O
self-affirmation O
manipulation O
was O
administered, O
we O
tracked O
participants' O
eye B-Physiological-Clinical
movements I-Physiological-Clinical
while O
they O
viewed O

of O
six O
moderately-severe O

six O

presented O
on O

Self-reported O
responses B-Life-Impact

were O
then O
measured, O
including O

Finally, O
participants O
reported O
their O
self-efficacy B-Life-Impact

and O
their O
alcohol B-Physiological-Clinical
use I-Physiological-Clinical
. O
RESULTS: O
There O
was O
no O
clear O
evidence O
that O
enhancing O
self-affirmation O
influenced O
any O
outcome. O

In O
comparison O
to O
moderately-severe O
health O

highly-severe O
health O
warnings O
increased O

and O
reactance B-Life-Impact
and O
were O
perceived O
as O
more O
effective O
and O
increased O

CONCLUSIONS: O
These O
findings O
call O
into O
question O
the O
validity O
of O
the O
self-affirmation O
manipulation, O
which O
is O
purported O
to O
reduce O

We O
discuss O

suggest O
that O
the O
efficacy O
of O
EHF O
is O
potentially O
inferior O
to O
that O

CONCLUSIONS:: O
We O
suggest O
that O
after O

exercises, O
the O
pelvis O
was O
more O
symmetrically O

in O

therefore, O
the O
muscles O

have O
functional O

did O
not O

or O
lengthen O

Therefore, O
continuous O
investigation O
of O
effective O
interventions O
for O

(SMV) O
is O
one O
of O
the O
interventions O
that O
incorporate O

All O
patients O
received O
3 O
sessions O
per O

of O
SPT O
for O
8 O
weeks. O

The O
SPT-SMV O
experimental O

BACKGROUND: O
Many O
surgical O
procedures O
have O
been O
described O
to O
treat O
recurrent O
patellar O
dislocation, O
but O
none O
of O
these O
techniques O
has O
been O
successful O
in O
all O
patients. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
the O
results O
of O
medial O
patellofemoral O
ligament O
reconstruction O
in O
children. O

Two O
operative O
procedures O
were O
evaluated; O
a O
fascia O
lata O
allograft O
and O
an O
autologous O
gracilis O
graft. O

METHODS: O
Forty-four O
children O
(27 O
girls O
and O
17 O
boys) O
between O
13 O
and O
17 O
years O
of O
age O
with O
unilateral O
recurrent O
patellar O
dislocation O
underwent O
medial O
patellofemoral O
ligament O
(MPFL) O
reconstruction. O

Patients O
were O
operated O
in O
two O
orthopedic O
centers. O

The O
1st O
group O
contained O
22 O
patients O
and O
surgery O
was O
performed O
using O
a O
fascia O
lata O
allograft. O

In O
the O
2nd O
group O
of O
patients O
which O
also O
contained O
22 O
children O
and O
autologous O
gracilis O
graft O
was O
used. O

The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
patients O
was O
14.9 O
years O
and O
the O
mean O
follow-up O
was O
24 O
months. O

Preoperatively, O
all O
patients O
were O
evaluated O
clinically O
( O
Kujala O
score O
questionnaire]) O
and O
radiologically. O

The O
same O
evaluation O
was O
used O
18 O
to O
30 O
months O
postoperatively O
to O
estimate O
the O
results O
of O
our O
treatment. O

RESULTS: O
In O
1st O
group O
of O
children O
operated O
with O
cadaver O
allografts, O
the O
Kujala O
score O
significantly O
improved O
from O
73.91 O
points O
preoperatively O
to O
94.50 O
points O
postoperatively O
(P O
< O
.001). O

The O
average O
duration B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact
operating I-Life-Impact
procedure I-Life-Impact
was O
1 O
hour O
and O
35 O
minutes. O

As O
shown O
by O
subjective O
symptoms B-Physiological-Clinical
, O
the O
results O
in O
95% O
of O
patients O
were O
rated O
as O
good O
or O
very O
good. O

All O
children O
returned O
to O
full B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact
. O
Similar O
results O
were O
obtained O
in O
patients O
in O
2nd O
group, O
where O
MPFL O
was O
reconstructed O
with O
ipsilateral O
gracilis O
tendon. O
[ O

T O
Kujala O
score O
increased O
from O
70.77 O
points O
preoperatively O
to O
94.32 O
postoperatively O
(P O
< O
.001). O

Our O
results O
were O
estimated O
as O
good O
or O
very O
good O
in O
93% O
of O
patients. O

All O
patients O
that O
were O
operated O
returned O
to O
full B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact
. O
However, O
median O
duration B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact
operation I-Life-Impact
was O
longer O
and O
lasted O
1 O
hour O
and O
55 O
minutes. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Both O
techniques O
were O
effective O
in O
the O
short-term O
(18-30 O
months) O
in O
treatment O
of O
recurrent O
patellar O
dislocation. O

The O
use O
of O
cadaver O

spares O
the O
hamstring B-Physiological-Clinical
muscles I-Physiological-Clinical
and O
reduces O
the O
time B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact

Therefore, O
such O
study O
appears O
to O
be O
useful O
because O

However, O
ED95 O
is O
more O

BACKGROUND: O
Vaccination O
has O
a O

public O
health O
impact. O

Maintaining O
vaccine O
coverage O
is O
key O
to O
avoid O
the O

In O
the O
Province O
of O
Quebec, O
vaccine O
coverage O
in O
young O
children O
are O
sub-optimal, O
mostly O
due O
to O
ambivalence O
toward O
vaccine O
safety O
and O
efficacy. O

We O
previously O
conducted O
a O
regional O
study O
in O
the O
Quebec's O
Eastern O

the O
PromoVac O
Study, O
to O

based O
on O
motivational O

techniques, O
aimed O
at O
promoting O
infant B-Life-Impact
vaccination I-Life-Impact
. O
This O
first O
study O
evidenced O
that O
the O
intervention O
led O
to O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
mothers' O
intention B-Life-Impact
to O
vaccinate, O
and O
vaccine B-Life-Impact

in O
their O
infants. O

The O
current O
study O
protocol O
aims O
at O
scaling O
up O
these O
results O
at O
a O
provincial O
level O
using O
a O
randomized O
controlled O
trial O
design. O

METHODS: O
This O
pragmatic, O
randomized, O

parallel-group O
clinical O
trial O
will O
compare O
the O
effectiveness O
of O
the O
motivational O

children O
born O
in O
participating O
maternity O

were O
recruited O
between O
March O

2015. O

Vaccination O
coverage O
will O
be O
assessed O
at O
3-years O
of O
age, O
thus O
the O
trial O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
completed O
in O
March O
2019. O

Statistical O
analyses O
will O
be O
conducted O
under O
the O

principle. O

Vaccine B-Life-Impact
coverage O
will O
be O
analyzed O
using O
Chi-squared O
distribution O
testing O
and O
logistic O
regression O
to O
identify O
determinant O
factors. O

Secondary O
outcomes O
will O
include O

DISCUSSION: O
In O
the O
case O

BACKGROUND: O
Neonatal O

is O
a O
major O

worldwide, O
with O
most O
deaths O

The O
World O

poster O
has O
been O
used O
to O
reduce O
hospital-acquired O

but O
there O
is O
no O
similar O
tool O
to O
prevent O
community-acquired O
newborn O
infections O
in O
low-resource O
settings. O

This O
assessment, O
part O
of O
the O
BabyGel O
Pilot O
study, O
evaluated O
the O
acceptability O
of O
the O
'Newborn O
Moments O
for O
Hand O
Hygiene O
in O
the O
Home' O
poster. O

This O
was O
an O
educational O
tool O
which O
aimed O
to O
remind O
mothers O
in O
rural O
Uganda O
to O
clean O
their O
hands O
to O
prevent O
neonatal O
infection. O

METHODS: O
The O
BabyGel O
pilot O
was O
a O
cluster O
randomised O
trial O
that O
assessed O
the O
post-partum O
use O
of O
alcohol-based O
hand O
rub O
(ABHR) O
to O
prevent O
neonatal B-Physiological-Clinical
infections I-Physiological-Clinical
in O
Mbale, O
Uganda. O

Fifty-five O
women O
in O
5 O
village O

received O
the O
ABHR O
and O
used O
it O
from O
birth O
to O
3 O
months O
postnatally, O
with O
use O
guided O
by O
the O
new O
poster. O

Following O
the O

(FGDs) O
were O
conducted O
consisting O
of O
6-8 O
purposively O
sampled O
participants O
from O

villages. O

FGDs O
were O
audio-recorded, O
transcribed O
then O
translated O

English. O

Transcripts O
were O
inductively O
coded O
using O
ATLAS.ti(R) O
and O
qualitatively O
analysed O
using O
thematic O

RESULTS: O
Most O
mothers O
reported O
that O
they O
understood B-Life-Impact
the O
message O
in O
the O
poster O
("The O

shows O
me O

healthy") O
and O
that O
they O
could O
adhere B-Life-Impact
to O
the O
moments O
from O
the O
poster. O

Some O
participants O
used O
the O
information O
from O
the O
poster O
to O
encourage B-Life-Impact
other O
caregivers O
to O
use O
the O
ABHR O
("after O
explaining O
to O
them, O
they O
liked O
it"). O

Other O
potential O
moments O
for O
hand B-Life-Impact
hygiene I-Life-Impact
were O
introduced O
by O
participants, O
such O
as O
after O
tending O
to O
domestic O
animals O
and O
gardening. O

CONCLUSION: O
The O
poster O
was O
well-received B-Life-Impact
, O
and O
participants O
reported O
compliance B-Life-Impact
with O
the O
moments O
for O
hand O
hygiene O
(although O
the O
full O
body O

The O

will O
be O
adapted O

RESULTS: O
Truckers O

compared O

There O

between O
those O

Of O

. O
Although O
the O

more O
than O
doubled O

because O

were O
so O
low O
in O
this O

CONCLUSIONS: O
Announcing O
the O

increased O
HIV B-Life-Impact

cycle. O

The O
control O

failed O
to O
increase O
after O
48 O
h, O
PRP O
infusion O
was O
repeated O
in O
the O

When O
the O
endometrium B-Physiological-Clinical
thickness I-Physiological-Clinical

increased O
significantly O
to O
8.67 O
+/- O
0.64 O
in O
PRP O
group O

This O
increase O
was O
higher O
in O
women O

The O
implantation B-Physiological-Clinical

BACKGROUND: O
Belatacept O
(Nulojix; O

is O
a O
biological O
immunosuppressive O
drug O
used O
for O
the O

We O
have O
developed O
a O

to O
measure O
belatacept O
in O
serum O
and O
applied O
this O

in O
a O
pharmacokinetic O
study O
in O

METHODS: O
CD80 O
was O
used O
to O
trap O
belatacept O
onto O
streptavidin-coated O
wells. O

Captured O
drug O
was O
quantified O
using O
Eu-labeled O
protein O

The O
assay O
was O
applied O
in O
a O
pilot O
pharmacokinetic O
study O
in O
renal O
transplanted O
patients O
receiving O
belatacept O
infusions. O

Belatacept O

A O

was O
developed O
to O

RESULTS: O
The O

Hypoxemia O

In O

Background O
Intravenous O

However, O
knowledge O
about O
their O
effects O

remains O
limited O
due O
largely O
to O
the O

METHODS: O
The O
168 O
patients O
in O
2 O
neurology O
clinics O
with O
chronic O
tension-type O
headache. O

The O
participants O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
one O
of O
two O
treatment O
groups O
for O
dry O
needling O
or O
sham O
dry O
needling, O
delivered O
in O
3 O
sessions O
a O
week O
for O
2 O
weeks. O

The O
160 O
patients O
fulfilled O
the O
study O
requirements. O

The O
dry O
needling O
was O
applied O
in O
active O
trigger O
points O
located O
in O
the O
musculature O
of O
the O
head O
and O
the O
neck. O

The O
patients O
received O
dry O
needling O
using O
sterile O
stainless-steel O
acupuncture O
needles O
of O
0.25 O
x O
40 O
mm O
and O
0.25 O
x O
25 O
mm O
dimensions. O

The O
sham O
dry O
needling O
procedure O
was O
applied O
into O
the O
adipose O
tissue O
located O
at O
any O
area O
where O
an O
active O
trigger O
point O
was O
absent. O

The O
primary O
outcome O
measurement O
was O
the O
headache B-Physiological-Clinical
intensity I-Physiological-Clinical
. O
Secondary O
outcomes O
were O
frequency O
and O
duration B-Physiological-Clinical
of I-Physiological-Clinical
headache I-Physiological-Clinical
, O
and O
quality B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact
life I-Life-Impact
, O
assessed O
by O
the O
Short O
Form-36. O

All O
outcomes O
were O
measured O
at O
baseline, O
at O
the O
end O
of O
2-week, O
and O
1-month O
follow-up O
period. O

RESULTS: O
In O
the O
dry O
needling O
group, O
intensity B-Physiological-Clinical
of, I-Physiological-Clinical
frequency I-Physiological-Clinical
and I-Physiological-Clinical
duration I-Physiological-Clinical
of I-Physiological-Clinical
headache I-Physiological-Clinical
, O
and O
the O
scores O
of O
Short O
Form-36 O
subscales O
were O
significantly O
improved O
after O
treatment O
(P O
< O
.05). O

In O
the O
dry O
needling O
group, O
all O
the O
effect O
sizes O
for O
headache O
variables O
were O
large. O

CONCLUSIONS: O
The O
results O
of O
this O
clinical O
trial O
suggest O
that O
trigger O
point O
dry O
needling O
in O
patients O
with O
chronic O
