OBJECTIVE O
Transthoracic B-Physiological-Clinical

is O
a O
factor O
determining O
the O

during O

. O

Minimising O
TTI O
increases O
the O
chances O

defibrillation O
. O

Most O
external O
defibrillation O
paddles O
are O
rectangular O
in O
shape O
and O
can O
, O
therefore O
, O
be O
placed O
in O
a O
transverse O
or O
longitudinal O
orientation O
. O

The O
apical O
paddle O
is O
often O
placed O
in O
a O
transverse O
orientation O
. O

This O
may O
theoretically O
result O
in O
a O
higher O
TTI O
than O
a O
longitudinal O
orientation O
because O
of O
poorer O
contact O
at O
the O
lateral O
paddle O

. O

We O
compared O
TTI O
with O
the O
apical O
paddle O
in O
both O
a O
transverse O
and O
longitudinal O
orientation O
. O

MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS O
Twenty O
sequential O

studied O
. O

A O
pair O
of O
defibrillator O
paddles O
were O
instrumented O
to O
measure O

TTI B-Physiological-Clinical
was O
recorded O
pre-operatively O
at O
end-expiration O
with O
the O
apical O
paddle O
in O
both O
longitudinal O
and O
transverse O
orientations O
. O

The O
sternal O
paddle O
was O
placed O
in O
a O
longitudinal O
orientation O
for O
all O
measurements O
. O

RESULTS O
TTI O
decreased O
in O
both O
transverse O
and O
longitudinal O
orientations O
as O
paddle O
force O
increased O
. O

Transverse O
paddle O
orientation O
resulted O
in O
a O
significantly O
( O

) O
higher O
TTI O

at O

CONCLUSION O
The O
longitudinal O

BACKGROUND O
Electrical O

Partly O
based O
on O
between-patient O
dispersion O
of O

has O
also O
been O
reported O
that O
long-term B-Physiological-Clinical

BP I-Physiological-Clinical
variability I-Physiological-Clinical
is O
greater O
for O
?-blocker O
than O
for O
calcium O

and O
other O
types O
of O
treatment O

GOALS O
To O
measure O
visit-to-visit O
intraindividual O
variations O
of O
both O
clinic O
and O
24-h O
mean O
BP O
in O

trial O
treated O
for O
4 O
years O
with O
either O
atenolol O
or O
lacidipine O
, O
and O
to O
check O
whether O
interindividual O
clinic O
and O
24-h O
BP O
variabilities O
during O
treatment O
can O
really O
be O
considered O
a O
surrogate O
of O
intraindividual O
variabilities O
in O
exploring O
differences O
between O
?-blocker O
and O
calcium O
antagonist O
treatments O
. O

METHODS O
Long-term O
intraindividual O
BP O
variability O
was O
defined O
as O
the O
coefficient O
of O
variation O
of O
the O
average O
systolic O
or O
diastolic O
values O
of O
clinic O
and O
24-h O
BP O
measured O
at O
each O
visit O
throughout O
the O
treatment O
period O
. O

Patients O
in O

RESULTS O
Visit-to-visit O

, O
the O
latter O
being O
two O
to O
three O
times O
greater O
than O
the O
former O
. O

Visit-to-visit O
intraindividual O
clinic O
SBP O
variability O
was O
only O
slightly O
lower O
on O
calcium O
antagonist O
than O
on O
?-blocker O
treatment O
but O
little O
or O
no O
between-treatment O
difference O
was O
found O
for O
visit-to-visit O
clinic O
DBP O
and O
ambulatory O
SBP/DBP O
particularly O
in O
patients O
under O
monotherapy O
throughout O
the O
study O

Interindividual O
BP O
variability O
was O
markedly O
greater O

the O
intra-individiual O
one O
of O
which O
it O
did O
not O
precisely O
reflect O
the O
treatment-induced O
changes O
. O

CONCLUSION O
In O
mild-to-moderate O
hypertensive O
patients O
, O
visit-to-visit O
BP O
variability O
does O
not O
differ O
substantially O
between O
?-blocker O

significantly O

hemorrhage B-Physiological-Clinical

Recurrent B-Physiological-Clinical

significantly O

in O

Therefore O
, O
the O

In O

arbitrary O
lower O

heparin O
given O

resulted O
in O

In O

factors O
for O

, O
the O
intermittent O
administration O

heparin O
in O
the O
higher O

preferable O
because O

In O

BACKGROUND O

Although O
the O

assessment O
technique O
( O
SWAT O
) O
has O
been O
widely O
used O
, O
it O
has O
two O
main O
problems O
: O
it O
is O
not O
very O
sensitive O
for O
low O
mental O
workloads O
and O
it O
requires O
a O
time-consuming O
card O
sorting O
pretask O
procedure O
. O

In O
this O
study O
are O
presented O
five O
variations O
of O
SWAT O
in O
an O
effort O
to O
overcome O
the O
limitations O
. O

Four O
of O
the O
variants O
used O
the O
continuous O
SWAT O
subscales O
while O
one O
used O
the O
discrete O
SWAT O
subscale O
. O

Fifteen O
subjects O
participated O
in O
the O
experiment O
. O

The O
scales O
were O
compared O
with O
the O
original O
SWAT O
scale O
in O
terms O
of O
sensitivity B-Physiological-Clinical
and O
pretask O
procedure O

when O
performing O

. O

The O
results O
show O
that O
all O
four O
variants O
are O
more O
sensitive O
than O
the O
conventional O
SWAT O
scale O
and O
that O
the O

Thus O
, O

be O
replaced O

METHODS O
A O
total O

61-86 O
years O
, O
underwent O
cataract O

performed O
by O
a O

. O

Three O
years O
after O

, O
the O
rate O

was O
analysed O
using O
the O
evaluation O
of O

. O

The O
results O
were O
related O
to O
the O
capsulorhexis O
position O
, O
which O
was O
assessed O
with O
a O
retroillumination O

. O

RESULTS O
If O
the O
capsulorhexis B-Physiological-Clinical
was O
located O
partially O
or O
completely O
off O
the O
optics B-Physiological-Clinical
of I-Physiological-Clinical
the I-Physiological-Clinical
IOL I-Physiological-Clinical
, O
compared O
to O
totally O
on O
the O
IOL B-Physiological-Clinical
, O
significantly O
more O
PCO B-Physiological-Clinical
was O
found O
( O
p O

) O
. O

When O
comparing O
within O
each O
IOL O
type O
, O
patients O
with O
AcrySof O
IOLs O
were O
found O
to O
have O
significantly O
less O
PCO B-Physiological-Clinical
when O
the O
capsulorhexis O
was O
totally O
on O
the O

( O
p O

. O

This O

was O
also O
significant O
in O

BACKGROUND O
There O
are O
several O
lines O
of O
evidence O
to O
indicate O
that O
the O
immune O
system O
plays O
an O
important O
role O
in O
the O
pathophysiology O
of O
autism O
. O

The O
objective O
of O
this O
study O
was O
to O
access O
the O
effects O
of O
pentoxifylline O
plus O
risperidone O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
autistic B-Life-Impact
disorder I-Life-Impact
. O

METHODS O
Forty O
children O
between O
the O
ages O
4 O
and O
12 O
years O
with O
a O
DSM O
IV-TR O
clinical O
diagnosis O
of O

were O
recruited O
. O

The O
children O
presented O
with O
a O
chief O
complaint O
of O
severely O
disruptive O
symptoms O
related O
to O
autistic O
disorder O
. O

Patients O
were O
randomly O
allocated O
to O
pentoxifylline+risperidone O
or O
placebo+risperidone O
for O
a O
10-week O
, O
double-blind O
, O
placebo-controlled O
study O
. O

The O
dose O
of O
risperidone O
was O
titrated O
up O
to O
3 O
mg/day O
, O
pentoxifylline O
was O
titrated O
to O
600 O
mg/day O
. O

Patients O
were O
assessed O
at O
baseline O
and O
after O
2 O
, O
4 O
, O
6 O
, O
8 O
and O
10 O
weeks O

. O

The O
measure O
of O
the O
outcome O
was O
the O
Aberrant O
Behavior O
Checklist-Community O
( O
ABC-C O
) O
. O

RESULTS O
The O
difference O
between O
the O
two O
protocols O
was O
significant O
as O
the O
group O
that O
received O
pentoxifylline O
had O
greater O

CONCLUSION O
The O
results O
suggest O
that O
combination O
of O

The O

Using O
this O

The O
detected O

are O
classified O
using O
all O

a O

An O
extensive O

When O
determining O
whether O

the O

The O
method O

is O
shown O
to O
outperform O
them O
all O

Performance B-Life-Impact
is O
close O

Superior O
modulation O

The O
performance O
of O
children O
with O

was O
compared O
in O
object-based O
positive O
and O
negative O

Object-based O
positive O
and O
negative O
priming B-Life-Impact
effects I-Life-Impact
were O
found O
in O
both O
groups O
of O

. O

This O
result O
provides O
the O
first O
evidence O
for O
the O
activation O
of O
object-based O
representations O
during O
visual O
search O
task O
performance O
and O
further O
supports O
the O
notion O
that O
both O
excitatory B-Physiological-Clinical
and I-Physiological-Clinical
inhibitory I-Physiological-Clinical
guidance I-Physiological-Clinical
mechanisms I-Physiological-Clinical
are O
involved O
in O

in O

. O

The O
children O
with O
autism O
were O
overall O
better O
than O
the O
typically O
developing O
children O
at O
visual B-Physiological-Clinical
search I-Physiological-Clinical
, O
thus O
replicating O
demonstrations O
of O
superior O
discrimination O
in O
autism O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
there O
was O
no O
difference O
between O
the O
magnitude O
of O
the O
positive O
nor O
the O
negative O
priming B-Life-Impact
effects I-Life-Impact
of O
the O
groups O
. O

This O
finding O
suggests O
that O
excitatory B-Physiological-Clinical

inhibitory I-Physiological-Clinical
control O
operate B-Resource-use
comparably O
in O

CONCLUSIONS O
Caffeine O

This O

a O
reason O

A O
