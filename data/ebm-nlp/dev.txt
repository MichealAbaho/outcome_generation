A O

In O
this O
paper O
, O
we O
explore O
a O
two-filter O
model O
, O
the O
simplest O
version O
of O
multi-channel O
models O
for O
frequency O
discrimination B-Physiological-Clinical
of O

. O

According O
to O
this O
model O
, O
frequency O

is O
based O
on O
a O
change O
in O
the O
relative O
output O
levels O
of O
two O
auditory O
filters O
, O
one O
centered O
below O
and O
the O
other O
above O
the O
frequency O
of O
the O
tone O
. O

This O
idea O
can O
explain O
the O
experimental O
results O
that O
frequency O
discrimination O
is O
relatively O
unaffected O
by O
randomization O
of O
stimulus O
level O
. O

Moreover O
, O
it O
suggests O
a O
close O
relationship O
between O
the O
ability O
of O
listeners O
to O
perform O
frequency O
discrimination O
of O
simple O

and O

The O

INTERPRETATION O
Our O

that O

does O
not O

affect O

and O
therefore O
might O
not O
be O
an O

The O
ability O
of O
sucrose O
to O
reduce O
clinical O

MAIN O
OUTCOME O
MEASUREMENTS O
The O
raw O

were O
analysed O

a O
custom-designed O

that O
quantifies O
the O
three-dimensional B-Physiological-Clinical

, O
qua O

and O
distribution O
over O

transverse I-Physiological-Clinical

. O

This O
three-dimensional O
stability O
was O
related O
to O

UTC O
categorises O

highly O

The O

was O
measured O
. O

Finally O
, O
the O

RESULTS O
Symptomatic O

( O

, O
thus O
less O

The O
mean O
maximum O

thickness I-Life-Impact
was O
9.2 O

group O
and O
6.8 O

The O
ICC O

METHODS O
Children O

participated O
in O
one O
of O
two O
experiments O
. O

Both O
experiments O
involved O
the O

Before O

, O
the O

by O
either O
an O
arrow O
or O
the O

RESULTS O
Children O

were O
slower O

suggests O
a O

In O

, O
regardless O

In O
Experiment O

, O
children O
were O

However O
, O
both O

CONCLUSION O
These O

OBJECTIVE O
Autism O
is O
a O
childhood-onset O
disorder O
of O
unknown O
, O
possibly O
of O
multiple O
aetiologies O
. O

The O
core O
symptoms O
of O
autism O
are O
abnormalities O
in O
social O
interaction O
, O
communication O
and O
behaviour O
. O

The O
involvement O
of O
neurotransmitters O
such O
as O
5-HT O
has O
been O
suggested O
in O
neuropsychiatric O
disorders O
and O
particularly O
in O
autistic O
disorder O
. O

Increased O
platelet O
5-HT O
levels O
were O
found O
in O
40 O
% O
of O
the O
autistic O
population O
, O
suggesting O
that O
hyperserotonaemia O
may O
be O
a O
pathologic O
factor O
in O
infantile O
autism O
. O

Therefore O
, O
it O
is O
of O
interest O
to O
assess O
the O
efficacy O
of O
cyproheptadine O
, O
a O
5-HT2 O
antagonist O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
autistic O
disorder O
. O

In O
this O
8-week O
double-blind O
, O

, O
we O
assessed O
the O

The O

The O

The O

not O

the O
aim O

avoidance O
of O

As O
a O

However O
, O
there O
were O
broad O

differences O
in O
the O

BACKGROUND O

the O

BACKGROUND O
The O
applications O
of O
minimally O
invasive O
surgery O
( O
MIS O
) O
and O

are O
rapidly O
expanding O
. O

Despite O
this O
expansion O
, O
our O
understanding O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
haptic O
feedback O
during O
laparoscopic O
surgery O
is O
incomplete O
. O

Although O
many O
surgeons O
believe O
that O
the O
use O
of O
minimally O
invasive O
techniques O
eliminates O
force O

and O

) I-Physiological-Clinical
, O
the O
importance O
of O
haptics O
in O
MIS O
has O
not O
been O
fully O
evaluated O
. O

There O
is O
considerable O
interest O
in O
the O
development O
of O

for O
MIS O
even O
though O
the O
importance O
of O

remains O
poorly O
understood O
. O

This O
study O
was O
designed O
to O
determine O
the O
ability O
of O

to O
interpret O

respect O

RESULTS O
Direct B-Physiological-Clinical
palpation I-Physiological-Clinical
was O
associated O
with O
the O

and O
was O
superior O

The O

this O

; O
their O
susceptibility O

not O
influence O

, O
and O
cognitive O
therapy O
reduced O

not O

. O

Earlier O
studies O
showed O
that O
cognitive O
therapy O
has O
anti-panic O
effects O
and O
exposure O
has O
anti-agoraphobic O
effects O
while O
other O
studies O
suggest O
that O
agoraphobia O
is O
a O
secondary O
complication O
of O
panic O
disorder O
. O

It O
was O
therefore O
hypothesized O
that O
cognitive O
therapy O
not O
only O
reduces O
panic O
but O
also O
agoraphobia O
and O
that O
it O
potentiates O
the O
effects O
of O
exposure O
in O

. O

Two O
groups O
of O
12 O
severe O
agoraphobics O
were O
treated O
with O
4 O
sessions O
of O
cognitive O
therapy O
followed O
by O
8 O
sessions O
of O
cognitive O
therapy O
combined O
with O
in O

The O
other O
12 O
received O
4 O
sessions O

, O
a O
presumably O
inert O
treatment O
that O
controls O

, O
followed O
by O
8 O
sessions O
of O
in O
vivo O
exposure O
that O
was O
framed O
in O
common O
behavioral O
terms O
. O

The O
initial O
cognitive O
therapy O
produced O
a O
significant O
reduction O
in O
panic B-Life-Impact
frequency I-Life-Impact
, O
while O
associative O
therapy O
did O
not O
affect O
panic O
. O

Neither O
cognitive O
therapy O
alone O

significantly O

After O

Studies O

scarce O

the O

Indeed O
, O
suicidality O
( O

is O
generally O
an O
exclusion O
criterion O
for O
participation O
in O
treatment O
studies O
of O
subjects O
with O
alcohol O

Consequently O
, O
to O
date O
, O
little O
is O
known O
about O
the O
optimal O
treatment O
of O
this O
population O
. O

The O
first O
study O
involving O
substance-abusing O
suicidal O
patients O
was O
an O
open-label O
trial O
conducted O
in O
the O
early O
1990s O
. O

This O
study O
involved O
12 O
patients O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
demonstrated O
recent O
suicidal B-Life-Impact
ideations I-Life-Impact
and O
had O
made O
a O
lifetime O
suicide O
attempt O
. O

The O
results O
of O
that O
open-label O
study O
demonstrated O
significant O
within-group O
improvement O
in O
both O
depressive O
symptoms O
( O
including O
suicidal O
ideations O
) O
and O
level O
of O
drinking O
. O

However O
, O
substantial O
residual O
depressive B-Life-Impact
symptoms I-Life-Impact
and O

persisted O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
trial O
. O

Also O
, O
because O
no O

control O
group O
was O
utilized O
, O
the O
authors O
of O
that O
study O
could O
not O
rule O
out O
the O
possibility O
that O
the O
apparent O
therapeutic O

from O

was O
the O
result O

the O

only O

The O

46 O
( O
90 O

) O
had O

in O
the O

. O

The O
results O
of O
that O
double-blind O
, O

study O
suggest O
that O
fluoxetine O
was O
effective O
in O
decreasing O
but O
not O
eliminating O
both O
the O
depressive O
symptoms O
( O

Further O

The O

BACKGROUND O

the O

We O

CONCLUSION O
The O

adopted O

MMC O

In O
the O
group O

Futraful O
alone O
the O
survival B-Mortality

the O

BACKGROUND O
Postoperative O
nausea O

vomiting O
( O
PONV O
) O
is O
still O
a O
common O
and O
major O
complication O
for O
surgical O
patients O
, O
which O

It O
is O

have O
also O

The O

to O
find O
an O

BACKGROUND O

The O

the O

BACKGROUND O
Prenatal O
exposure O
to O
alcohol O
is O
a O
major O
, O
preventable O
cause O
of O
neurobehavioral O
dysfunction O
in O
children O
worldwide O
. O

The O
measurement O
and O

of O
saccadic O
eye O
movements O
is O
a O
powerful O
tool O
for O
assessing O
sensory O
, O

, O
and O
cognitive O
function O
. O

The O
quality O
of O
the O
motor O
process O
of O
an O
eye O

is O
known O
as O
saccade O

. O

Saccade O
accuracy O
is O
1 O
component O
of O

, O
which O
to O
function O
optimally O
requires O
several O
cortical O
brain O
structures O
as O
well O
as O
an O
intact O
cerebellum O
and O

. O

The O

has O
frequently O
been O
reported O
to O
be O
damaged O
by O
prenatal O
alcohol O

This O

therefore O
, O
tested O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
children O

( O

) O
will O
exhibit O
deficits O
in O
the O
accuracy O
