BACKGROUND O
: O
Krill O
powder O
is O
rich O
in O
bioactive O
ingredients O
such O
as O
eicosapentaenoic O
acid O
(EPA) O
, O
docosahexaenoic O
acid O
(DHA) O
, O
phospholipids O
, O
protein O
and O
astaxanthin O
. O

Containing O
dominantly O
EPA O
, O
it O
is O
considered O
to O
be O
effective O
in O
lowering O
lipids O
, O
foremost O
serum O
triglycerides O
and O
LDL O
cholesterol O
. O

Krill-derived O
protein O
hydrolysates/peptides O
may O
have O
positive O
effect O
on O
blood O
pressure O
and O
astaxanthin O
has O
anti-oxidative O
and O
anti-inflammatory O
properties O
. O

Thus O
, O
krill O
powder O
has O
a O
lot O
of O
potential O
in O
improving O
lipid O
and O
metabolic O
profile O
and O
reinforcing O
the O
activity O
of O
the O

However O
, O
randomized O

are O
scarce O
and O
systematic O
data O
of O
krill O

The O
aim O
of O
this O

METHODS O
: O
We O
conducted O
a O

RESULTS O
: O

. O

Barriers O
were O
regrouped O
into O
five O
categories O
: O
structural O
factors O
(e.g. O
, O
policies O
, O
social O
context O
, O
local O
workforce O
development O
, O
and O
physical O
aspects O
of O

, O
organizational O
factors O
(e.g. O
, O

and O
collaboration O
within O

across O
healthcare O
organizations) O
, O
provider O
factors O
(e.g. O
, O
previous O
mental O

characteristics) O
, O
patient O
factors O
(e.g. O
, O
beliefs O

, O
and O
motivation O
to O

care) O
, O
and O
innovation O
factors O
(e.g. O
, O

characteristics) O
. O

These O
contextual O
factors O
interacted O
with O
the O

to O
influence O
knowledge O
about O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Pharmacologic O
angiotensin O
axis O

(AAB) O
has O
been O
associated O
with O
profound O
hypotension O
following O
anesthetic O
induction O
with O

To O

this O
problem O
, O

has O
not O

compared O
with O
the O
most O

agent O
, O
propofol O
. O

Hence O
, O
the O
primary O
objective O
was O
to O
study O
the O
hypothesis O
that O
methohexital O
confers O
a O
better O
hemodynamic B-Physiological-Clinical
profile O
than O
propofol O
for O
anesthetic O
induction O
, O
in O
patients O
receiving O
AAB O
. O

The O
secondary O
objective O
was O
to O
investigate O
the O
postinduction O
levels O
of O
serum O
neurohormones B-Physiological-Clinical

an O

Patients O
were O
randomized O
to O
receive O
equi-anesthetic O
doses O
of O
either O
propofol O
or O
methohexital O
for O

. O

Hemodynamic B-Physiological-Clinical
variables O
were O
measured O
and O
blood O
samples O
were O
drawn O
before O
induction O
and O
for O
15 O
minutes O
afterwards O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
Methohexital O
resulted O
in O
less O

(P O

A O

MATERIALS O
AND O
METHODS O
: O
This O
study O
was O
a O
clinical O
trial O
in O
which O
80 O
patients O
suffering O
from O
cancer O
were O
randomly O
assigned O
to O
two O
groups O
of O
experimental O

In O
the O
experimental O
group O
, O
the O
patients O
performed O
relaxation O
techniques O
once O
a O
day O
for O
30min O
over O
two O
months O
. O

In O
the O
control O
group O
, O
the O
patients O
received O
the O
routine O

. O

RESULTS O
: O
A O
statistically O
significant O

was O
observed O
between O
the O
mean O

The O
overall O
approach O

of O
malaria O
, O
and O
sustainable O
preventive O
measures O
, O

Interestingly O
, O
the O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Health O
promotion O
programs O
can O
only O
lead O
to O
improvements O
in O
health O
outcomes O
if O
they O
are O
effectively O
implemented O
. O

However O
, O
most O
studies O
assessing O
implementation O
success O
focus O
on O
only O
one O
condition O
, O
although O
more O
conditions O
influence O
this O
process O
. O

Therefore O
, O
evidence O
is O
scarce O
on O
what O
conditions O
play O
a O
role O
in O
successful O
implementation O
and O
how O
they O
interact O
. O

Hence O
, O
we O
aimed O
to O
identify O
which O
combinations O
of O
teacher O
and O
implementation O
process O
characteristics O
affected O
the O
emotional B-Life-Impact
and O
social O
school O
experience O
(SCE) O
of O
pupils O
participating O
in O
a O
school-based O
health O

METHODS O
: O
This O
study O
was O
part O
of O
an O
effectiveness O
and O
process O
evaluation O
including O
24 O
intervention O
and O
27 O

. O

We O
used O
fuzzy-set O
qualitative O

analysis O
(fsQCA) O
to O
identify O
combinations O
of O
conditions O
that O
were O
associated O
with O
either O
an O
increase O
or O
no O
increase O
in O

outcome O

(SCE) O
in O
comparison O
to O
the O
control O
group O
at O
20 O
months O

. O

We O
deductively O
selected O
five O
conditions O
based O
on O
the O
Consolidated O
Framework O
for O
Implementation O
Research O
: O
teachers' O
perceived O

RESULTS O
: O
We O
identified O
five O
different O
pathways O
that O
led O
to O
no O
increase O
in O
the O
pupils' O
outcome O
(parameters O

The O
combination O
of O
an O
unsatisfying O
quality B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact
implementing I-Life-Impact
the O
intervention O
and O
a O
low O
previous O
knowledge B-Life-Impact
about O
the O
intervention O
showed O
the O
highest O
empirical O

. O

Similarly O
, O
fewer O
physical B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact

in O
combination O
with O
other O
conditions O
impeded O
the O
program's O
success O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
we O
identified O
two O
different O
pathways O
characterizing O
ways O
to O
success O
(consistency O
: O

The O
most O
relevant O
combination O
was O
good O
quality O
implementation O
of O
physical B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact
breaks I-Life-Impact
, O
implemented O
by O

with O
a O

and O
a O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
QCA O
has O
potential O
for O
an O
in-depth O
analysis O
of O
complex O
interventions O
as O
it O
can O
rely O

the O
following O

: O
The O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Both O
LASIK O

BACKGROUND O
: O
The O

INTRODUCTION O
: O
Halitosis O
is O
the O
term O
used O
to O
describe O
any O
unpleasant O
odor O

of O
its O
source O
. O

The O
prevalence O
of O
halitosis O
in O
the O
population O
is O
approximately O
30% O
, O
of O
which O
80 O
to O
90 O
% O
of O
the O
cases O
originate O
in O
the O
oral O
cavity O
resulting O
from O
proteolytic O
degradation O
by O
gram O

BACKGROUND O
: O
The O
prevalence O
of O
obesity O
has O
increased O
significantly O
worldwide O
within O
the O
last O
decade O
. O

As O
obesity O
is O
recognised O
as O
a O
contributing O
factor O
when O
developing O
various O
health O
threatening O
chronic O
diseases O
, O
prevention O
initiatives O
focusing O
on O
weight O
loss O
are O
becoming O
more O
important O
. O

Because O
of O
the O
time O
spent O
at O
the O
workplace O
, O
workplaces O
can O
be O
optimal O
arenas O
for O
weight O
loss O
programs O
and O
these O
programs O
have O
been O
effective O
to O
decrease O
body O
weight O
. O

Thus O
, O
reasons O
for O
engaging O
in O
weight O
loss O
interventions O
needs O
exploring O
, O
in O
order O
to O
engage O
more O
workplaces O
in O
weight O
loss O
interventions O
. O

Such O
information O
provides O
important O
knowledge O
that O
may O
help O
to O
inform O
decisions O
of O
municipalities O
, O
employers O
and O
other O
public O
health O
decision O
makers O
, O
when O
and O
if O
implementing O
weight O

interventions O
. O

The O
aim O
of O
this O
study O
was O
therefore O
to O
explore O
reasons O
for O
employee O
engagement O
in O
weight O
loss O
projects O
at O
the O
workplace O
and O
the O

, O
and O
a O
project O

have O
to O
launch O
such O
project O
. O

METHODS O
: O
A O

workers O
were O
interviewed O
at O
the O
end O
of O
a O

identified O
different O
views O
and O
considerations O
for O
engaging O
in O
a O
weight O

at O
the O
workplace O
. O

For O
the O
representative O
of O
the O
municipality O
the O

However O
, O
the O
employees O
were O
influenced O
by O
several O
factors O
, O
such O
as O
their O
own O
health O
and O
weight O

therefore O
, O
the O

did O
not O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Many O
surgical O
procedures O
have O
been O
described O
to O
treat O
recurrent O
patellar O
dislocation O
, O
but O
none O
of O
these O
techniques O
has O
been O
successful O
in O
all O
patients O
. O

The O
goal O
of O
the O
study O
was O
to O
evaluate O
the O
results O
of O
medial O
patellofemoral O
ligament O
reconstruction O
in O
children O
. O

Two O
operative O
procedures O
were O
evaluated O
; O
a O
fascia O

and O
an O
autologous O

. O

METHODS O
: O
Forty-four O
children O
(27 O
girls O
and O
17 O
boys) O
between O
13 O
and O
17 O
years O
of O
age O
with O
unilateral O
recurrent O
patellar O
dislocation O
underwent O
medial O
patellofemoral O
ligament O
(MPFL) O
reconstruction O
. O

Patients O
were O
operated O
in O
two O
orthopedic O
centers O
. O

The O
1st O
group O
contained O
22 O
patients O
and O
surgery O
was O
performed O
using O
a O
fascia O

allograft O
. O

In O
the O
2nd O
group O
of O
patients O
which O
also O
contained O
22 O
children O
and O
autologous O
gracilis O

was O
used O
. O

The O
mean O
age O
of O
the O
patients O
was O
14.9 O
years O
and O
the O
mean O
follow-up O
was O
24 O
months O
. O

Preoperatively O
, O
all O
patients O
were O
evaluated O
clinically O
( O
Kujala O

and O
radiologically O
. O

The O
same O
evaluation O
was O
used O
18 O
to O
30 O
months O
postoperatively O
to O
estimate O
the O
results O
of O
our O
treatment O
. O

RESULTS O
: O
In O
1st O
group O
of O
children O
operated O
with O
cadaver O
allografts O
, O
the O
Kujala O
score O
significantly O
improved O
from O
73.91 O

preoperatively O
to O
94.50 O

postoperatively O
(P O
< O

. O

The O
average O
duration B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact
operating I-Life-Impact
procedure I-Life-Impact
was O
1 O

. O

As O
shown O
by O
subjective O
symptoms B-Physiological-Clinical
, O
the O
results O
in O
95 O
% O
of O
patients O
were O
rated O
as O
good O
or O
very O
good O
. O

All O
children O
returned O
to O
full B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact
. O
Similar O
results O
were O
obtained O
in O
patients O
in O
2nd O
group O
, O
where O
MPFL O
was O
reconstructed O
with O
ipsilateral O
gracilis O

. O
[ O

T O
Kujala O
score O
increased O
from O
70.77 O
points O
preoperatively O
to O
94.32 O
postoperatively O
(P O

. O

Our O
results O
were O
estimated O
as O
good O
or O
very O
good O
in O
93 O
% O
of O
patients O
. O

All O
patients O
that O
were O
operated O
returned O
to O
full B-Life-Impact
activity I-Life-Impact
. O
However O
, O
median O
duration B-Life-Impact
of I-Life-Impact
operation I-Life-Impact
was O
longer O
and O
lasted O
1 O
hour O
and O
55 O
minutes O
. O

CONCLUSIONS O
: O
Both O
techniques O
were O
effective O
in O
the O
short-term O
(18-30 O
months) O
in O
treatment O
of O
recurrent O
patellar O

. O

The O
use O

Although O
