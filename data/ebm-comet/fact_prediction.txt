CONCLUSIONS : Whilst daily betaA may confer individual benefits , these results demonstrate limited impact of betaA (irrespective of dosing strategy) on 30-min rowing or subsequent sprint performance . Further investigation of betaA dosage > 2.4 g.d( - 1) and/or chronic intervention periods (> 4-8 weeks) may be warranted based on within-group observations .

Depressive symptoms were collected by the Beck Depression Inventory-II] . Logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between seafood products and omega-3 PUFA consumption and depression . Multiple linear regression models were fitted to assess the association between fish and long-chain (LC) omega-3 PUFA intake and depressive symptoms . RESULTS : Out of 6587 participants , there were 1367 cases of depression . Total seafood consumption was not associated with depression . The odds ratios (ORs) (95 % confidence intervals (CIs)) for the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th quintiles of consumption of fatty fish were 0.77 (0.63(-)0.94) , 0.71 (0.58(-)0.87) , and 0.78 (0.64(-)0.96) , respectively , and p for trend = 0.759 .

Only PPI therapy significantly decreased the VAS scores , suggesting the improvement of taste perception . Moreover , PPI therapy significantly decreased recognition thresholds for bitter taste in the anterior tongue (chorda tympani nerve area) and the thresholds in the posterior tongue (glossopharyngeal nerve area) for salty , sour , and bitter tastes . By contrast , H2-blocker therapy caused no significant changes of thresholds in the anterior tongue , but improved the threshold {only} for bitter in the posterior tongue , the value of which was however significantly higher than that in PPI group .

However , in patients with a low BMI , the LBW protocol delivered a significantly higher [MASK] than the TBW protocol (620.7 vs 600.0 mg iodine/kg , P < 0.001) .
However , in patients with a low BMI , the LBW protocol delivered a significantly higher dose than the TBW protocol (620.7 vs 600.0 mg iodine/kg , P < 0.001) .

The 95 % confidence interval for the difference in aortic and hepatic enhancement between the 2 protocols was within the range of the predetermined equivalence margins in all BMI subgroups .
The 95 % confidence interval for the difference in aortic and hepatic [MASK] between the 2 protocols was within the range of the predetermined equivalence margins in all BMI subgroups .
The 95 % confidence interval for the difference in aortic and hepatic dose between the 2 protocols was within the range of the predetermined equivalence margins in all BMI subgroups .

CONCLUSIONS : Contrast enhancement was equivalent under both protocols .
CONCLUSIONS : [MASK] [MASK] was equivalent under both protocols .
CONCLUSIONS : Treatment [MASK] was equivalent under both protocols .
CONCLUSIONS : Treatment ##ment was equivalent under both protocols .

The LBW protocol can avoid iodine overdosing , especially in patients with a high BMI .
The LBW protocol can avoid iodine [MASK] , especially in patients with a high BMI .
The LBW protocol can avoid iodine pain , especially in patients with a high BMI .

Conclusions and Relevance : Among ambulatory adults with hypertension , treating to a systolic blood pressure goal of less than 120 mm Hg compared with a goal of less than 140 mm Hg did not result in a significant reduction in the risk of probable dementia . Because of early study termination and fewer than expected cases of dementia , the study may have been underpowered for this end point .

However , Kruskal Wallis test did not show a significant relationship between the three positions under study and the mean gastric residual volume . CONCLUSION : Prone position was featured with the lowest gastric residual volume and highest possibility of absorbing nutrient . Still , given the fact that no significant difference was found in the three groups , further and deeper studies are needed .

Compared to the control group , the patients in the intervention group had lesser urine albumin/creatine ratio [47(26 , 120) mg/g vs 68(28 , 158) mg/g , P=0.039] , and lower serum cystatin C [(0.83+/-0.30) mg/L vs (0.96+/-0.30)mg/L , P=0.041] . Berberine had no obvious adverse effects .

Seventeen patients (17%) in the MRI-guided treat-to-target group and 6 patients (6%) in the conventional treat-to-target group experienced serious adverse events . Conclusions and Relevance : Among patients with RA in clinical remission , an MRI-guided treat-to-target strategy compared with a conventional treat-to-target strategy did not result in improved disease activity remission rates or reduce radiographic progression . These findings do not support the use of an MRI-guided strategy for treating patients with RA .
