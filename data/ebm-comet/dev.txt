BACKGROUND O
: O
Given O
the O

in O

of O
physical O
activity O
in O
early O
adolescence O
, O
promoting O
physical O
activity O
in O
young O
people O
is O
a O
priority O
for O

. O

School O
physical O

(PE) O
is O
an O
important O
existing O
network O

The O

hypothesize O
that O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Vaccination O
has O
a O
huge O
public O
health O
impact O
. O

Maintaining O
vaccine O
coverage O
is O
key O
to O
avoid O
the O

. O

In O
the O
Province O
of O
Quebec O
, O
vaccine O
coverage O
in O
young O
children O
are O
sub-optimal O
, O
mostly O
due O
to O
ambivalence O
toward O
vaccine O
safety O
and O
efficacy O
. O

We O
previously O
conducted O
a O
regional O
study O
in O
the O
Quebec's O
Eastern O
Townships O
region O
, O
the O
PromoVac O
Study O
, O
to O
test O
a O
new O
educational O
intervention O
, O
based O
on O
motivational O
interviewing O
techniques O
, O
aimed O
at O
promoting O
infant B-Life-Impact
vaccination I-Life-Impact
. O
This O
first O
study O
evidenced O
that O
the O
intervention O
led O
to O
a O
marked O
increase O
in O
mothers' O
intention B-Life-Impact
to O
vaccinate O
, O
and O
vaccine B-Life-Impact
coverage O
in O
their O
infants O
. O

The O
current O
study O
protocol O
aims O
at O
scaling O
up O
these O
results O
at O
a O
provincial O
level O
using O
a O

. O

METHODS O
: O
This O
pragmatic O
, O
randomized O

, O
parallel-group O

trial O
will O
compare O
the O

Adult O

born O
in O
participating O
maternity O
wards O
were O
recruited O
between O
March O
2014 O
and O
February O
2015 O
. O

Vaccination O
coverage O
will O
be O
assessed O
at O
3-years O
of O
age O
, O
thus O
the O
trial O
is O
expected O
to O
be O
completed O
in O
March O

Statistical O

be O
conducted O
under O
the O

will O
be O

In O
the O

BACKGROUND O
: O
Congenital O
nasolacrimal O
duct O
obstruction O
(CNLDO) O
is O
common O
and O
. O

lacrimal O
duct O
probing O
is O
the O
major O
treatment O
. O

But O
persistent O
CNLDO O
in O
older O
children O
makes O
the O
success O
rate O
rapidly O
decreased O
due O
to O
long-term O
chronic O
inflammation O
. O

To O
improve O
the O
success O
rate O
, O
probing O
combined O
with O
tobramycin/dexamethasone O
ointment O
is O
considered O
effective O
. O

But O
in O
practice O
, O
we O
found O
a O
lot O
of O
problems O
in O
using O
the O
ointment O
. O

So O
we O
tried O
tobramycin/dexamethasone O
eye O
drops O
as O
a O
replacement O
. O

The O
results O
is O
surprising O
, O
so O
we O
hope O
to O
do O
some O
further O
research O
in O
order O
to O
prove O
it O
is O
worth O
to O
clinical O
application O
. O

OBJECTIVE O
: O
To O
evaluate O
the O

of O
lacrimal O

The O
data O
of O
age O

were O
analyzed O
through O

Then O
the O

were O
divided O
into O
2 O

by O
age O
, O
12 O

and O
25 O

The O
surgical B-Physiological-Clinical

in O
two O

were O
compared O
. O

This O
assessment O
, O

the O
'Newborn O

This O

aimed O
to O
remind O

in O
rural O
Uganda O
to O
clean O
their O

METHODS O
: O
The O
BabyGel O
pilot O
was O
a O
cluster O
randomised O

that O
assessed O
the O
post-partum O
use O
of O

Fifty-five O

RESULTS O
: O

and O
that O
they O

Some O

The O

Although O

Trimethylamine O

BACKGROUND O

The O
